Basic Concepts and Terminology.

## System

<Think>
    What is a system?
</Think>

In the world of control systems, there is no a single definition of a system that can be considered THE definition. However, all definitions have certain properties in common, and terminology varies depending on the author. Below are some definitions of a system.


<Definition term="System">
    Interconnections of elements and devices for a desired purpose.

    Source: @dorfModernControlSystems2017

</Definition>

<Definition term="System">
A control system consists of subsystems and processes (or plants) assembled for the purpose of obtaining a **desired output** with **desired performance**, given a **specified input**.

Source: @niseControlSystemsEngineering2015
</Definition>

Other definition,

<Definition term="System">
A system is a combination of components that act together and perform a certain objective. A system need not be physical. The concept of the system can be applied to abstract, dynamic phenomena such as those encountered in economics. The word system should, therefore, be interpreted to imply physical, biological, economic, and the like, systems.

There are standards such as @DINIEC600503512014 that provide a “standardized definition” of different terms. Unfortunately, you have to pay to access them.

/>

This set of *devices/components/elements* could be **sensors** and **actuators** for example.


<Definition term="System (formal)">
A systen is model by function $\Sigma$ that maps from the input space into the output space.

    $$
    \Sigma : \sU \rightarrow \sY, \quad y = \Sigma(u)
    $$

Where each admissible input signal $u \in \sU$ is map to an unique output signal $y \in \sY$.

Using functional notation:

    $$
    \vy = \Sigma(\vu) \in \sY
    $$

## Plant and Process

Different authors use the terms plant and process to refer to the same part of a system.

<Definition term="Plant">
A plant may be a piece of equipment, perhaps just a set of machine parts functioning together, the purpose of which is to perform a particular operation.

@niseControlSystemsEngineering2015 does not draw a distinction between plant and process (though he predominantly uses plant). As he writes *"A generic open-loop system is shown in Figure 1.5(a). [...].  The controller drives a process or a plant."*, the terms are used synonymously, with plant referring to the system being acted on by the controller.

@franklinFeedbackControlDynamic2020 distinguish "process" as a **subset** of the "plant", where $\textrm{plant = process + actuator}$ (see Fig. 1.2: *"The combination of process and actuator is called the plant [...]"*). Despite this structural distinction, the Chapter 1 summary also states *"A simple feedback system consists of the process (or plant) whose output is to be controlled [...]"*, implying some equivalence; throughout the book, plant is the predominant term.

@astromFeedbackSystemsIntroduction2021 use "process" for what @franklinFeedbackControlDynamic2020 would call the "plant". In their control-loop descriptions (i.e. Figure 1.4), the label plant is not used as part of the pipeline; process is the preferred term.

@ogataModernControlEngineering2010 in chapter 1 explicitly defines both "process" and "plant", but then uses plant almost exclusively in the text. In Ogata’s definition, the actuator is not part of the plant (see Fig. 2.6), which makes his notion of plant effectively equivalent to @franklinFeedbackControlDynamic2020 's definition of process.

@dorfModernControlSystems2017 treat the terms interchangeably: "plant" is cross-referenced as "See Process" and Process is defined as "The device, plant, or system under control." The book uses both terms as synonyms in practice.

In summary: Any controllable device or object can be referred to as a plant or process.

## Disturbances

<Definition term="Disturbances">
A disturbance is a signal that tends to **adversely** affect the value of the output of a system. If a disturbance is generated within the system, it is called *internal*, while an *external* disturbance is generated outside the system and is an input."

## Sensor

<Definition term="Sensor">
Device that receives and responds to a signal or stimulus.

Source: Handbook of modern sensors: physics, designs, and applications by Jacob Fraden
</Definition>


<Definition term="Sensor">
A sensor is a device that receives a physical, chemical, or biological stimulus and responds with a quantification of this stimulus in the form of a signal that can be interpreted, transmitted and/or stored. The device that performs this quantization is called a transducer.

## Actuator

<Definition term="Actuator">
An actuator is a device that converts energy (typically electrical, hydraulic, or pneumatic)

Interconnections.

### Open-Loop Systems

Also known as Feed-Forward systems.

assumption:
- the plant is a static system (the dynamics of the plant does not change over time)
- the definition of the system plant can be subject to modelling errors.
- contraint that the inverse can be computed

### Closed-Loop Systems

### Causality

### System State

### System Dimension


@franklinFeedbackControlDynamic2020:
- Stability. The system must be stable at all times. This is an absolute requirement.
- Tracking. The system output must track the command reference signal as closely as possible.
- Disturbance rejection. The system output must be as insensitive as possible to disturbance inputs.
- Robustness. The aforementioned goals must be met even if the model used in the design is not completely accurate or if the dynamics of the physical system change over time.

### Reduce the Model

By mathematical modelling you can reduce blocks.

### Analyze and Design

In this phase, the engineer analyzes the system to see if the response specifications and performance requirements can be met by simple adjustments of system parameters.

Types of responses:
- impulse
- step
- ramp
- sinusoidal
