Basic Concepts and Terminology.

## System

<Think>
    What is a system?
</Think>

In the world of control systems, there is no a single definition of a system that can be considered THE definition. However, all definitions have certain properties in common, and terminology varies depending on the author. Below are some definitions of a system.


<Definition term="System">
    Interconnections of elements and devices for a desired purpose.

</Definition>

<Definition term="System">
A control system consists of subsystems and processes (or plants) assembled for the purpose of obtaining a **desired output** with **desired performance**, given a **specified input**.

</Definition>

Other definition,

<Definition term="System">
A system is a combination of components that act together and perform a certain objective. A system need not be physical. The concept of the system can be applied to abstract, dynamic phenomena such as those encountered in economics. The word system should, therefore, be interpreted to imply physical, biological, economic, and the like, systems.

There are standards such as @DINIEC600503512014 that provide a “standardized definition” of different terms. Unfortunately, you have to pay to access them.

/>

This set of *devices/components/elements* could be **sensors** and **actuators** for example.


<Definition term="System (formal)">
An systen is model by function $\Sigma$ that maps from the input space into the output space.

    $$
    \Sigma : \sU \rightarrow \sY, \quad y = \Sigma(u)
    $$

Where each admissible input signal $u \in \sU$ is map to an unique output signal $y \in \sY$.

Using functional notation:

    $$
    \vy = \Sigma(\vu) \in \sY
    $$

## Plant and Process

Different authors use the terms plant and process to refer to the same part of a system.

<Definition term="Plant">
A plant may be a piece of equipment, perhaps just a set of machine parts functioning together, the purpose of which is to perform a particular operation.

Ogata refers to "process" as any operation to be controlled.

    description="Representation of a process."
/>
In summary: Any controllable device or object can be referred to as a plant or process.

## Disturbances

<Definition term="Disturbances">
A disturbance is a signal that tends to **adversely** affect the value of the output of a system. If a disturbance is generated within the system, it is called *internal*, while an *external* disturbance is generated outside the system and is an input."

## Sensor

<Definition term="Sensor">
Device that receives and responds to a signal or stimulus.

Source: Handbook of modern sensors: physics, designs, and applications by Jacob Fraden
</Definition>


<Definition term="Sensor">
A sensor is a device that receives a physical, chemical, or biological stimulus and responds with a quantification of this stimulus in the form of a signal that can be interpreted, transmitted and/or stored.

## Actuator

<Definition term="Actuator">
An actuator is a device that converts energy (typically electrical, hydraulic, or pneumatic)

### Transform Requirements Into a Physical System

### Draw a Functional Block Diagram

### Identify the Variables to be Controlled

- Space station orientation and control moment gyro momentum.
- Mean arterial pressure.
- UAV vertical position

### Create a Schematic

<Drawio
    file="control-001.drawio"
    page="8"
    description="Schematic diagrams for different disciplines. Each diagram is used to illustrate the dynamics of a feedback system."
/>

### Develop a (Mathematical) Model

- Block Diagrams
- Modelling from Experiments

<Drawio
    file="control-001.drawio"
    page="9"
    description="Standard block diagram elements. The arrows indicate the the inputs and outputs of each element, with the mathematical operation corresponding to the blocked labeled at the output."
/>

### Reduce the Model

By mathematical modelling you can reduce blocks.

### Analyze and Design

In this phase, the engineer analyzes the system to see if the response specifications and performance requirements can be met by simple adjustments of system parameters.

Types of responses:
- impulse
- step
- ramp
- sinusoidal
