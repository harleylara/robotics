## Before to start

Create an `ament_cmake` built-type package called `demo_interfaces`

```plain
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake demo_interfaces
```

## Topics

Topics are:
- publishers/subscribers
- Anonymous
- Strongly-typed

<Drawio
    file="ros.drawio"
    page="6"
    description="Simple Topic-based interface."
/>

For details about topics names: check [Names in ROS 2](/en/ros2-ws#names-in-ros-2).

### Publishers/Subscribers

Topics use a asynchronous communication paradigms refer as publication/subscription:
- publishers don’t know if anyone’s listening
- subscribers are event-triggered (by incoming messages)
- messages may be dropped

### Anonymous

Topics are anonymous: "This means that when a subscriber gets a piece of data, it doesn’t generally know or care which publisher originally sent it (though it can find out if it wants). " from [Official ROS docs](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/Basic/About-Topics.html#anonymous).

### Strongly-typed

The communication using topic relies in the concept of messages.

## Messages

Messages are a way for a ROS 2 node to send data on the network to other ROS nodes, with no response expected. Messages are described and defined in `.msg` files in the `msg/` directory of a ROS package.

### Message Definition Structure

<Drawio
    file="ros.drawio"
    page="7"
    description="Simple message definition."
/>

Structure:
- Field type
- Field name
- Field with constant value
- Field with default value

### Field Types

- [Built-in-type](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/Basic/About-Interfaces.html#field-types)
- Using other message as the type to define a field (nesting messages)

### Field with Constant Value

<Important
    note="Field names with constant values have to be UPPERCASE"
/>

## Creating a Simple Message

with in the `demo_interfaces` package, let's create a folder called `msg`.

<Terminal
    title="Create a 'msg' folder"
    content="mkdir msg"
/>

Inside `msg` directory create a file called `Counter.msg` with the following content:

<CodeBlock
    filename="Counter.msg"
    code="" 
    lang="plain"
    remoteURL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harleylara/ros2-intro/master/demo_interfaces/msg/Counter.msg"
/>

Add the `rosidl_default_generators` and "friends" to the `package.xml` of the `demo_interfaces` package.

```xml
<buildtool_depend>rosidl_default_generators</buildtool_depend>
<exec_depend>rosidl_default_runtime</exec_depend>
<member_of_group>rosidl_interface_packages</member_of_group>
```

Add the following code to the `CMakeLists.txt`:

```CMakeLists
find_package(rosidl_default_generators REQUIRED)

rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}
  "msg/Counter.msg"
)
```

Build the message definition:
<Terminal
    title="Build the workspace"
    content="cd ~/ros2_ws/ && colcon build --symlink-install"
/>
