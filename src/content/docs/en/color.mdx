WHy a note about color in the context of robotics?

This note stated as a note in **Colorimetry**.
Light -> Color Physical -> Color digital -> Cameras

Outline
- Physical properties of light that lead to color (Photometry)
- Color as a perception (Colorimetry)


(Sept. 2025) Still within a internal debate if I should make a note about light.

"The eye is not a linear system".
"language shapes are mind" (I thinks is is from somewhere but dont know where), this applied for color.

color by structure vs color by pigment
