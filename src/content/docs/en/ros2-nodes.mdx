## What is a Node


<Definition
    term="ROS Node"
    definition="test"
    source="Own definition inspired by Wiki ROS"
    url="https://wiki.ros.org/Nodes"
/>

Namespace: prefix to apply to entities associated with the node (node name, topics, etc).

A node is used to create ROS entities:
- publisher
- subscriber
- services
    - service server
    - service client
- actions
    - action server
    - action client
- configurable parameters (run-time)

Nodes can communicate with other nodes within:
- the same process
- in a different process
- on a different machine.

Ideally each node should do one logical thing.

<Important
    note="A ROS node can be composed of none, one or several ROS entities, each with their respective interfaces."
/>

## Creating a Bare Minimum Node

A bare minimum node without any ROS entity.

<CodeBlock
    filename="bare.py" 
    code="" 
    lang="py"
    remoteURL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harleylara/ros2-intro/master/python_basics/python_basics/bare.py"
/>

Remember that packages of type `ament_python` are structured like a standard python packages using [`setuptools`](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html). So, to make your node usable as a `console script` add an `entry_points` kwarg inside the `setup()` function within the `setup.py` file of your package. Check [Setuptools - Entry Points](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html) for more details.

```python filename="setup.py"
...

entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
        'bare = python_basics.bare:main',
    ],
},

...
```

<Drawio
    file="ros-nodes.drawio"
    page="0"
    description="Node entry points structure description."
/>

<Terminal
    title="format for console_scripts"
    content="ENTRY_POINT_NAME = PACKAGE_NAME.MODULE_NAME:ENTRY_POINT"
    prompt={false}
/>

## Running Nodes

You can run ROS nodes using the ROS `cli` with the following format:
```plain
ros2 run <package_name> <node_entry_point_name>
```

In this case:
```plain
ros2 run python_basics bare
```

erros?... here's a list of common mistakes you may be making:
- `ros2 command not found` (assuming you have ROS correctly installed using debian packages) Have you already source the underlying workspace? `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`
- `Package 'python_basics' not found` (assuming you have the package in the `src` folder in your workspace)
    - remember that every time you have new code files that you want to execute you must **build** the workspace, have you already done it? in the root directory of your workspace `colcon build --symlink-install`
    - have you already activated the overlaying workspace (your worksapce)? `source ~/ros2_ws/install/local_setup.bash`

clearly not all possible error cases can be covered, so it is advisable to read the error message and try to understand it (I know, sometimes, just sometimes, error messages are not very useful).

In case you haven't wondered yet. You: *"Wait!?, my node is python, why do I need to build my workspace if python is interpreted and does not require compiling.?"*. Let me tell you that is an excellent question, `colcon build` does not only compile code, it has the potential to do many more things that we will not mention here (but you can see [colcon docs](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/)), in the case of `ament_python` packages colcon does not compile the code, but instead copies it from your package to the `lib` directory inside the `install` folder of the workspace. However this copy alone is not enough, you must source the workspace in a way that lets ROS know that there are new files in the install folder.

The `--symlink-install` directive tells colcon not to perform a hard-copy (default behavior) but to perform a symlink of the files, this option is extremely useful when you are developing with python as it allows you to make changes to your file and because it is just a symbolic link the changes are automatically reflected from the file perspective in the `install` folder, which means that if you use `--symlink-install` you don't have to do `colcon build` for every time you change the file (example `bare.py`), but you have to redo `colcon build --symlink-install` **once** every time there is a new file, this is for the purpose of creating the symlink of the new file. e.g. a new node called `new.py` and then you can just keep changing the file since the symlink already exist.

<Important
    note="The symlink concept is not exclusive for nodes, but also applies to any type of shared resource such as launch files, configurations, urdfs etc. Just keep in mind that currently (March 2024) there are no mechanisms to create symlinks for the resources specified in the `setup.py` section `data_files` of your `ament_python`."

## Coding a Minimum Logger

coding a logger (`logger.py`) in the package `python_basics`, code [here](https://github.com/harleylara/ros2-intro/blob/master/python_basics/python_basics/logger.py)

<CodeBlock
    filename="logger.py" 
    code="" 
    lang="py"
    remoteURL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harleylara/ros2-intro/master/python_basics/python_basics/logger.py"
/>

Don't forget to add the entry point in the `setup.py`: `logger = python_basics.logger:main`

## Using Classes (Recommended)

coding a logger using classes (`class.py`) in the package `python_basics`, code [here](https://github.com/harleylara/ros2-intro/blob/master/python_basics/python_basics/class.py)

<CodeBlock
    filename="class.py" 
    code="" 
    lang="py"
    remoteURL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harleylara/ros2-intro/master/python_basics/python_basics/class.py"
/>

Don't forget to add the entry point in the `setup.py`: `class = python_basics.class:main`

## Capabilities



Nodes can:
- publish data
- subscribe data
- act as a service client
- act as a service server
- act as a action client
- act as a action server

Nodes are often a complex combination of publishers, subscribers, service servers, service clients, action servers, and action clients, all at the same time.

More about `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` in the [official docs](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/Intermediate/About-Domain-ID.html)

I'm planning to explain more in the [DDS](/en/ros2-dds) page.
