> How can we model a random process or "experiment"? For example how can we define the process of throwing a die.

The answer to this is providad by the concept of **Probability Space**: is a mathematical construct that provides a formal model of a random process or "experiment". [Probability Space - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space)

## The Building Blocks

from Probability Essentials by Jean Jacod and Philip Protter "The theory of probability aims towards a mathematical theory which describes such phenomena. This theory contains three main ingredients":
- **Sample space** $\Omega$
- **Event space** $\mathcal{A}$
- **The probability** $P$


### Sample Space

**Sample space** $\Omega$, also known as "state space": ALL possible outcomes. (an arbitrary non-empty set)

### Event Space

**Event space** $\mathcal{A}$, also known just as "events": An event space contains all possible events for a given experiment, [source](https://www.statisticshowto.com/event-space-probability/). (the set of all the subsets of $\Omega$)
- this is a $\sigma$-algebra [Definition: Event Space - ProofWiki](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Event_Space#:~:text=The%20event%20space%20of%20E,a%20sigma%2Dalgebra%20on%20%CE%A9.)
- The *event space* is the **power set** of the *sample space*. The power set (or powerset) of a set $S$ is the set of all subsets of $S$, **including** the **empty** set and $S$ **itself**.

Let $2^\Omega$ denote all subsets of $\Omega$, including the empty set denoted by $\emptyset$. With $\mathcal{A}$ being a subset of $2^\Omega$, we consider the following properties:

Property 1:

<Equation
    formula="\emptyset \in \mathcal{A} \text{ and } \Omega \in \mathcal{A}"
    description="The empty-set and the sample space are part of the *event space*"
/>

Property 2:
<Equation
    formula="\text{If } A \in \mathcal{A} \text{ then } A^{c} \in \mathcal{A} \text{, where } A^{c} \text{ denotes the complement of } A"
    description="Property 2 of $\sigma$-algebra"
/>

Property 3:
A is closed under finite unions and finite intersections

### The Probability

**The probability** $P$


### WTF is "Closed"?

*"closed"* (in set theory) indicate that when you perform a particular operation on elements or subsets of a set, the result remains within the same set.

Operations:
- Addition
- Union
- Iterception
- Complement

### Closed Under Addition

Examples of closed under addition:
- Natural Numbers $\mathbb{N}$. The sum of any two natural numbers result in another natural number.
- Integers $\mathbb{Z}$. The sum of any two integers result in another integer.
- Real Numbers $\mathbb{N}$: The sum of any two real numbers result in another real number.
- Rational Numbers $\mathbb{Q}$: The sum of any two rational numbers result in another rational number.

Examples of Not closed under addition:
- A set of odd numbers
- A set of prime numbers

### Closed Under Union
