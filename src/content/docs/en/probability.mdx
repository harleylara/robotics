I took the following excerpt from the from [Introduction to Bayesian Scientific Computing](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-73394-4) and decided to copy it as it is written because I think it is very well put:

*"[...] randomness means lack of information. The degree of information or more generally, our belief about the outcome of a random event is expressed in terms of probability."*

*"That said, it is clear that the concept of probability has a **subjective** component, since it is a subjective matter to decide what is reasonable to believe, and what previous experience the belief is based on. The concept of probability advocated in this book is called **subjective probability**, which is often a synonym of **Bayesian probability**"*

<Think
    note="How can we model a random process or 'experiment' in away that allow us to predict the outcome? For example how can we define the process of throwing a die?"
/>

The answer to this is provided by the concept of **Probability Space**: is a mathematical construct that provides a formal model of a random process or "experiment". [Probability Space - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space)

Let's break it down.

## The Building Blocks

from [Probability Essentials by Jean Jacod and Philip Protter](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-55682-1) *"The theory of probability aims towards a mathematical theory (the probability space) which describes such phenomena. This theory (the probability space) contains three main ingredients"*:
- **Sample space**: $\Omega$
- **Event space**: $\mathcal{A}$
- **The probability measure**: $P$

This formalization of this theory is largely due to [Andrey Kolmogorov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov).

### Sample Space

**Sample space** $\Omega$, also known as "state space": This is a set of **ALL** possible outcomes of the experiment. For expample if you throw a die with 6 faces all the possible outcomes can be represented as:

<Equation
    formula="\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}"
    description="Sample space of throwing a 6 faces die."
/>

If the experiment is throwing two coins the sample space is as follow:

<Equation
    formula="\Omega = \{hh, tt, ht, th\}\text{, where } h \text { is head and } t \text{ is tail}"
    description="Sample space of throwing throwing two coins."
/>

    page="7"
    description="Sample space examples."
/>


### Event Space

Let's derive the event space concept intuitively with an example first.

<Drawio
    file="probability.drawio"
    page="8"
    description="Power set of the sample space."
/>

**Event space** $\mathcal{A}$, also known just as "events": An event space is a set that contains ALL possible events for a given experiment, [source](https://www.statisticshowto.com/event-space-probability/). (the set of all the subsets of $\Omega$)


Let represent the powerset with $2^\Omega$ which denote all subsets of $\Omega$, including the empty set denoted by $\emptyset$. With $\mathcal{A}$ being a subset of $2^\Omega$, we consider the following properties:

Property 1:

<Equation
    formula="\emptyset \in \mathcal{A} \text{ and } \Omega \in \mathcal{A}"
    description="The empty-set and the sample space are part of the *event space*"
/>

Property 2:
<Equation
    formula="\text{If } \sA \in \mathcal{A} \text{ then } \scA \in \mathcal{A} \text{, where } \scA \text{ denotes the complement of } \sA"
    description="The **event space** $\mathcal{A}$ is closed under complement."
/>

Property 3:
<Equation
    formula="\forall \sA_1, \sA_2, \dots \sA_n \in \mathcal{A}, \quad \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} \sA_i \in \mathcal{A} \quad \text{and} \quad \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} \sA_i \in \mathcal{A}"
    description="The **event space** $\mathcal{A}$ is **closed** under *finite* **unions** and **intersections**."
/>

<Definition
    term="Finite set"
    definition="In mathematics, particularly set theory, a finite set is a set that has a finite number of elements.. Example the set of all outcomes of throwing a dice ${1,2,3,4,5,6}$."
    source="Finite set - Wikipedia"
    link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set"
/>

Property 4:

<Equation
    formula="\forall \sA_1, \sA_2, \dots \sA_n \in \mathcal{A}, \quad \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} \sA_i \in \mathcal{A} \quad \text{and} \quad \bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} \sA_i \in \mathcal{A}"
    description="The **event space** $\mathcal{A}$ is **closed** under *countable* unions and intersections."
/>

<Definition
    term='Countable set'
    definition="In mathematics, a set is countable if either it is finite or it can be made in one to one correspondence with the set of natural numbers ([A bijection, bijective function, or one-to-one correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection))."
    source="Countable set - wikipedia"
    link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set"
/>

The event space $\mathcal{A}$ is an algebra if it satisfies properties 1, 2 and 3 above. It is a $\sigma$-algebra, (or a $\sigma$-field) if it satisfies 1, 2, and 4 above. Closure under countable unions directly implies closure under finite unions because a finite union is a special case of countable union. Specially:

For any finite collection of sets $\sA_1, \sA_2, \dots, \sA_n \in \mathcal{A}$ the union $\sA_1 \cup \sA_2 \cup \dots \cup \sA_n$ is just a particular case of the countable union.

Keep in mind that the properties 1 and 4 emplies 3, hence any $\sigma$-algebra is a algebra but there are algebras that are not $\sigma$-algebras.

### The Probability

**The probability** $P$


### WTF is "Closed"?

*"closed"* (in set theory) indicate that when you perform a particular operation on elements or subsets of a set, the result remains within the same set.

Operations:
- Addition
- Union
- Iterception
- Complement

### Closed Under Addition

Examples of closed under addition:
- Natural Numbers $\mathbb{N}$. The sum of any two natural numbers result in another natural number.
- Integers $\mathbb{Z}$. The sum of any two integers result in another integer.
- Real Numbers $\mathbb{N}$: The sum of any two real numbers result in another real number.
- Rational Numbers $\mathbb{Q}$: The sum of any two rational numbers result in another rational number.

Examples of Not closed under addition:
- A set of odd numbers
- A set of prime numbers
