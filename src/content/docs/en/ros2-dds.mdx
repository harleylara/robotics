## What is DDS?

"The DDS specification describes a Data-Centric Publish-Subscribe (DCPS) model for distributed application communication and integration"

"The Data Distribution Service (DDS) for real-time systems is an Object Management Group (OMG) machine-to-machine (sometimes called middleware or connectivity framework)"

- dependable
- high-performance
- interoperable
- real-time
- scalable data exchanges 
-  distributed discovery system

using a publishâ€“subscribe pattern.
