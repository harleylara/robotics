In simple words: Is a collection of **specific** *subsets* of a given set that satisfies certain properties.

## Properties

Let $\Omega$ be the **sample space**, ALL possible outcomes.

Let $2^\Omega$ denote all subsets of $\Omega$, including the empty set denoted by $\emptyset$. With $\mathcal{A}$ being a subset of $2^\Omega$, we consider the following properties:

> $\mathcal{A}$ is refer as the **event space** (or sometimes just "event")

## WTF is "Closed"

"closed"  indicate that when you perform a particular operation on elements or subsets of a set, the result remains within the same set.

Operations:
- Addition
- Union
- Iterception
- Complement

### Closed Under Addition

Examples of closed under addition:
- Natural Numbers $\mathbb{N}$. The sum of any two natural numbers result in another natural number.
- Integers $\mathbb{Z}$. The sum of any two integers result in another integer.
- Real Numbers $\mathbb{N}$: The sum of any two real numbers result in another real number.
- Rational Numbers $\mathbb{Q}$: The sum of any two rational numbers result in another rational number.

Examples of Not closed under addition:
- A set of odd numbers
- A set of prime numbers

### Closed Under Union
