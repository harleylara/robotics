title: Time Complexity
---

decidable -> computationally solvable -> does not translate to practice, it may require an inordinate amount of time or memory.


There are multiples parameters that determine the number of steps to run an algo, if the input is a graph:
- number of nodes
- number of edges
- maximun degree of the graph
- or some combination and/or other factors

<Definition term="Time Complexity">
    Let $M$ be a deterministic Turing machine that halts on all inputs. The **running time** or **time complexity** of $M$ is the function:

    $$
    f : \N \rightarrow \N
    $$

    where $f(n)$ is the maximun number of steps that $M$ uses on any input of length $n$.

Commonly the exact run time of an algorithm is a complex expresion (long, convolute not using complex variables or any of that) 

To overcome the problem is common to use **asymptotic analysis** (an estimation)

<Definition term="Big-O notation">
    Let $f$ and $g$ be functions that $f, g : \N \rightarrow \R^{+}$. We say that $f(n) = O(g(n))$ if positive integers $c$ and $n_0$ exist such that for every integer $n \geq n_0$,

    $$
    f(n) \leq c g(n)
    $$

    When $f(n) = O(g(n))$, we say that $g(n)$ is an **upper bound** for $f(n)$, or more precisely, that $g(n)$ is an **asymptotic upper bound** for $f(n)$, to emphasize that we are suppressing constant factors.

see this as a "rate of change" therefor the contast factor $c$ does not change the rate

<Definition term="small-o notation">
    Let $f$ and $g$ be functions $f, g : \N \rightarrow \R^{+}$. Say that $f (n) = o(g(n))$ if

    $$
    \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty } \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = 0
    $$

    In other words, $f(n) = o(g(n))$ means that for any real number $c > 0$, a number $n_0$ exists, where $f(n) < c g(n)$ for all $n \geq n_0$.
