I'm using the world Computational science as wide umbrella term intead of refering it as Computer Science.

## History

- [Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz): *"the world's first computer scientist."* first to publish @BlochLaurent2015:
    - [infinitesimal calculus (1684)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Methodus_pro_Maximis_et_Minimis)
    - [Pinwheel calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinwheel_calculator) first machine that could perform all four arithmetic operations (1673),
    - [Stepped reckoner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepped_reckoner) the first machine with an internal memory.
    - binary computers (1679)
    - Algebra of Thought (1686) deductively equivalent[LE18] to the much later Boolean Algebra
    - Characteristica Universalis & Calculus Ratiocinator

## Automata and Languages

Automata theory: mathematical models of computation = computational model



<Definition term="Alphabet">
A finite, non-empty set of objects called **symbols**

    $$
    \Sigma_1= \{0, 1\}
