## Vector

> In mathematics, physics, and engineering, a Euclidean vector or simply a vector (sometimes called a geometric vector or spatial vector) is a geometric object that has magnitude (or length) and direction.

Operation on vecotrs:
- Scalar multiplication
- Addition and Subtraction
- Length
- Normalized vector
