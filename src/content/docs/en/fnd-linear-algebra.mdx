## Vector

> In mathematics, physics, and engineering, a Euclidean vector or simply a vector (sometimes called a geometric vector or spatial vector) is a geometric object that has magnitude (or length) and direction.
source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector

Operations on vectors:
- Scalar multiplication
- Addition and Subtraction
- Length
- Normalized vector
- Dot product
- Cross product

### Scalar Multiplication
