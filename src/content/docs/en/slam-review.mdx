Two key computational solutions:
- EKF-SLAM: standard Bayesian form
- FastSLAM: use of RaoBlackwellised particle filters

> "The genesis of the probabilistic SLAM problem occurred at the 1986 IEEE Robotics and Automation Conference held in San Francisco."

- high degree of correlation between estimates of the location of different landmarks in a map
    - these correlations would grow with successive observations

- 1995 the acronym SLAM is used for the first time. H. Durrant-Whyte, D. Rye, and E. Nebot. Localization of automatic guided vehicles.
