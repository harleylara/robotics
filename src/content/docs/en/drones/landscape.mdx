    - open-hardware standards
    - pros and cons of open-standards

    - historical notes on hardware projects (no standards)
        - the ardupilot (initially hardware project) and the apm [(ardupilot mega)](https://www.ardupilot.co.uk/)
        - in 2013 autopilot (now just software project) change to pixhawk. see [ardupilot](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-history-of-ardupilot.html)

## Open-Source

You've probably heard the term **open-source software** (OSS), but have you heard of **open-hardware**?, also referred to as **open-source hardware** (OSH), what about **open-standard**?

Open-source is not about just making the source code accessible, but who gets to define what is open-source ? ... the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/about) is " a California public benefit corporation, with 501(c)3 tax-exempt status, founded in 1998."  with the vison of "leading voice on the policies and principles of open source [...]", the organization is compose of big player in the open-source scene like the Linux Foundation or the Python Foundation just to mention some. So we can rely on their definition of open source:

<Definition term="Open-Source">

    Open source doesn’t just mean access to the source code. The distribution terms of open source software must comply with the following criteria:
    1. Free distribution
    2. Source code
    3. Derived works
    4. Integrity of the author’s source code
    5. No discrimination against persons or groups
    6. No discrimination against fields of endeavor
    7. Distribution of license
    8. License must not be specific to a product
    9. License must not restrict other software
    10. License must be technology-neutral

    Source:  [The Open Source Definition (Annotated)](https://opensource.org/definition-annotated)
</Definition>

Under that definition you can find a list of  [OSI Approved Licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses).

Why is Open-source so important:
- [study about the impact of open source software and hardware on technological independence, competitiveness and innovation in the eu economy](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/study-about-impact-open-source-software-and-hardware-technological-independence-competitiveness-and)
- [open source maturity in europe](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/world-of-open-source-eu-2024?hslang=en)

## Open-Hardware

There is not software without hardware,

## Open-Standards

- [open standards vs. open source: a basic explanation](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/open-standards-vs-open-source-explanation)

open-standards:
- [the importance of open standards](https://us.profinet.com/importance-open-standards/)
- [open standards, proprietary standards, and in between](https://us.profinet.com/open-standards-proprietary-standards/)
- [open standard - wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open_standard)
- [risc-v - wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/risc-v)

Having a open-standard around the drone hardware like the flight controller make thing more interoperable. For example Pixhawk "The open standards for drone hardware"

## Building an Open Ecosystem

autopilots firmwares (for pixhawk-based flight controllers)
- [px4](https://px4.io/). px4 is hosted by [dronecode foundation](https://dronecode.org/), a [linux foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) non-profit.
- [ardupilot](https://ardupilot.org/). community-driven project, fuel by volunteer and [corporate partners](https://ardupilot.org/ardupilot/docs/common-partners.html)

ground control station (gcs)
- what is ground control station
- communication flight controller to gcs (brief on mavlink)
- ground control station software (mavlink-based systems)
    - [mission planner](https://ardupilot.org/planner/)
    - [qgroundcontrol](https://qgroundcontrol.com/)

## How Does it Scale

Sure, all this Open Ecosystem is nice, but, does it scale ?

Actully, yes, here some commercial solution that are running on top of all or most of the elements of the ecosystem

px4-based companies:
- [auterion](https://auterion.com/)
- [freefly systems](https://freeflysystems.com/)
- watts innovations (shutdown in q3 2024) . signed with waltmart, see [walmart drone delivery, powered by watts innovations’ drone](https://www.thedroneu.com/blog/walmart-drone-delivery-powered-by-watts-innovations-drone/).
- [easy aerial](https://www.easyaerial.com/)
- [commercial systems](https://px4.io/ecosystem/commercial-systems/)

ardupilot-based:
- [flyby robotics](https://www.flybyrobotics.com/#specs)
- [usa military](https://x.com/usarmy/status/1918999091456934238), [project convergence capstone 5 (pc-c5)](https://archive.ph/txdll): ardupilot based drones.
- [ukraine bombers](https://x.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1930265730525585521)

non-open standard, apart from DJI:
- [skydio](https://www.skydio.com/) usa-based. [skydio x10](https://www.skydio.com/x10). base-price [15k usd](https://youtu.be/saolljrvdz0?t=872) to +23k usd
- [acsl](https://acsl-usa.com/) made-in-japan
- parrot
- [inspired flight](https://www.inspiredflight.com/)
