## Definitions and Terminologies

- Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS), the later prefer by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)
  - Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPVs)
  - Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)

Get the definition on UAS by the EASA:

- Drone
- Aerial Robot (a more generic term)
- Companion computer
- Ground Control Stations

For a more comprehensive list of terms and definition see:
- Definitions and Terminology  from Hand-book


## Short Historical Notes

TODO (can be skipped in lecture)

## Taxonomy

### Flight Dynamics

important taxonomy of UAV is the aerodynamical classification:
- Fixed-wing
- rotative-wing: normally can have different numbers of rotors also called multi-rotors
  - 1: helicopter
  - 3: tricopter
  - 4: quadcopter
  - 6: hexacopter
  - 8: octocopter


### Weight

### Flight Altitud and Range

## Current Applications (in production environments)

## Future application (state of the art, in lab environments)

## High-Level UAV Avionics Architecture

## Open Challenges of drones

From the technology perspective, skipping regulatory challenges (this can be a whole lecture).

- quiet (for multi-rotors)
- more energy dense bateries
- compact-power efficient computers
- more integrated fallback detections
