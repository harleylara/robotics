Nice case: `n` linear equations, `n` unknowns

- Row picture
- Column picture
- Matrix form

Example of a system of linear equations:

<Equation
    formula="\begin{cases}2x - y = 0 \newline -x + 2y = 3\end{cases}"
    description="System of two linear equations with two unknowns."
/>

## Row Picture

This can be represented as a matrix operation:

<Equation
    formula="
    \begin{bmatrix}
    2 & -1 \\ 
    -1 & 2
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y
    \end{bmatrix}
    = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    0 \\
    3
    \end{bmatrix}"
    description="Matrix form of the previous system of linear equations."
/>

In a simplified form:

<Equation
    formula="\mA \vx = \vb"
    description="System of linear equations."
/>

To solve this system of linear equation we need to find a value for $x$ and $y$ that satisfies the right hand side (rhs) in every equation.

## Column Picture

<Equation
    formula="x\begin{bmatrix}2 \\ -1\end{bmatrix} + y\begin{bmatrix}-1 \\ 2\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 3\end{bmatrix}"
    description="Linear combination of system of linear equations."
/>

This is called `Linear combination` and is amazing!.
