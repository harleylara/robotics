## Guided Transmission Media

### Twisted-pair

Cool video about the story of [TWISTED: The dramatic history of twisted-pair Ethernet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8PP5IHsL8Y)


- [Full-duplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)#Full_duplex): Links that can be used in both directions at the same time.
- [half-duplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)#Half_duplex): links that can be used in either direction, but only one way at a time.
- [simplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)#Simplex): links that allow traffic in only one direction.

See list of cable categories: [Standard types of twisted pair cabling - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_pair#Building_infrastructure)

### Coaxial Cable

Common types:
- 50-ohm: is commonly used when it is intended for digital transmission.
- 75-ohm: is commonly used for analog transmission and cable television.

### Power Lines

### Fiber Optics


[chromatic dispersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics))
[Soliton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliton)

Signal sources:
- LEDs
- semiconductor lasers


two-way communication requires either two fibers or two frequency bands on one fiber.

## Wireless Transmission

### The Electromagnetic Spectrum

[IEEE 521-2002, IEEE Standard Letter Designations for Radar-Frequency Bands](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/521/768/)

### Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)

[Hedy Lamarr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr) [U.S. patent 2,292,387](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e0/dd/4e/0e04d56d1d7604/US2292387.pdf). Her scheme used 88 frequencies, the number of keys (and frequencies) on the piano.

### Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)

### Ultra-Wideband Communication
