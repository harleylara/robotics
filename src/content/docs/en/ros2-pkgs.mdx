## Packages in ROS 2

<Definition
term="ROS package"
definition="A ROS package is an organizational unit for your code, configuration files and any other resources necessary for the proper operation of your code."

<Think
note="Why do we need a so called 'ROS Package'?"
/>

ROS Packages allow you to make your code shareable within other systems that also use ROS, so it is reasonable to think of a ROS package as an analogue to for example a *python package* (like [numpy](https://numpy.org/)).

ROS 2 support the following packages types:
- [`ament_python`](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/How-To-Guides/Developing-a-ROS-2-Package.html): This package type is design to contain python code. ROS follows a [standard Python package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/) structure defined by the [Python Packaging Authority](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/). Such packaging functionality is provided by `colcon`, which internally uses [setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html).
- [`ament_cmake`](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Documentation.html): This package type is design to contain C++ code. ROS uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) with a set of **custom cmake macros** to handle C++ packaging. For those curious check out [ament_cmake github](https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/tree/rolling)
- [`ament_cmake_python`](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Python-Documentation.html)

Regardless of the type of package, all of them must contain a file called `package.xml` which is a **Package Manifest File** with meta-data about the package. The latest (version 3) format specification is under [REP 149](https://ros.org/reps/rep-0149.html)
- Common tags:
    - `<buildtool_depend>`: Needed to build itself. (Typically ament_cmake)
    - `<build_depend>`: Needed to build this package.
    - `<exec_depend>`: Needed to run code in this package.
    - `<depend>`: Needed to build, export, and execution dependency.
- Uncommon tags:
    - `<build_export_depend>`: Needed to build against this package.
    - `<test_depend>`: Only additional dependencies for unit tests.
    - `<doc_depend>`: Needed to generate documentation.

## ROS `cli` Tool for Packages

ROS offers a command line interface (CLI), which has functions for interacting with packages, for example:
- `ros2 pkg create`: to create the minimal template structure of a given package type (default `ament_cmake`).
- `ros2 pkg list`: list all the "available" packages. Note that you need to source the corresponding workspace to make the package available for ROS.

### CMake-based package

```bash filename="ament_cmake_package_structure"
my_package
├── include/my_package/
├── src/
├── CMakeLists.txt
└── package.xml
```

`CMakeLists.txt`: standard CMake rules to build the package. Most relevant parts:
- `add_executable(myNode src/myNode.cpp)`: Builds program `myNode` from `myNode.cpp`.
- `ament_target_dependencies(myNode rclcpp std_msgs)`: Links node `myNode` to dependency headers and libraries.
- `install(TARGETS myNode DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME})`: Copies nodes/libraries to workspace’s “install” directory.

### Python-based package

```bash filename="ament_python_package_structure"
my_package/
├── resource/my_package
├── my_package/
├── setup.cfg
├── setup.py
└── package.xml
```

`setup.py`: python package definition. Most relevant parts:
- `data_files`
- `entry_points`

Let's create a `ament_python` into the `src` folder inside the workspace:

<Terminal
    title="create a ament_python package"
    content="cd ~/ros2_ws/src/\
    ros2 pkg create my_package --build-type ament_python --dependencies rclpy std_msgs"
/>

<Important
    note="Don't forget to build and source the workspace after adding packages to it."
/>

## Install Existing Packages

### Debian Packages

- Easy to install
- Usually stable
- Recommended

Structure: `sudo apt-get install ros-<DISTRO>-<PACKAGE-NAME>`

For example, to install the package called `teleop_twist_keyboard` using debian packages:

<Important
    note="When installing ros packages using debian packages replace '_' with '-' in the name of the package."
/>

<Terminal
    title="install packages from debian packages"
    content="sudo apt-get install ros-humble-teleop-twist-keyboard"
/>

To remove a package use:

<Terminal
    title="remove a package (but not dependencies)"
    content="sudo apt-get remove ros-<DISTRO>-<PACKAGE-NAME>"
/>

### Packages from Source

1. Git clone the repository (watch out the git branch) of the package into your `src` folder into the workspace.

```plain
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/harleylara/ros2-intro.git
```

2. Install dependencies if need it either manually (painful way), or using [`rosdep`](https://docs.ros.org/en/independent/api/rosdep/html/). Keep in mind that `rosdep` is not magic, it cannot guess the dependencies of your package or third party packages, `rosdep` will check inside the `package.xml` of the package for the defined dependencies, so be organized and don't forget to add your dependencies inside the package manifest.

```plain
sudo apt update && rosdep install -r --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro $ROS_DISTRO -y
```

3. Build the workspace using `colcon`.

```plain
cd ~/ros2_ws/
colcon build --symlink-install
```

4. Source the workspace to make the package available.
```plain
source install/local_setup.bash
```
