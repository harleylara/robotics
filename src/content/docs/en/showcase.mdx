import Cube from '../../../components/Figures/Cube.astro';
import LeastSquareError from '../../../components/AutoMobile/LeastSquareError.astro';
import LineProblem from '../../../components/AutoMobile/LineProblem.astro';
import LaserData from '../../../components/AutoMobile/LaserData.astro';
import MeasurementError from '../../../components/AutoMobile/MeasurementError.astro';

## Markdown Support

Support for [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) and [GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown)](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

## Code Blocks

Standard markdown code block use triple ` ``` `, you can pass arguments:

- `lang`: code language for highlight
- `filename`: show file name on header of the code block.
- `remoteURL`: remote source to fetch the content of the code block.

## Custom Components

I can create custom component and import them along the markdown note:

```jsx
import Cube from '../components/Figures/Cube.astro';

## Some cool text

Insert the custom component:

<Cube/>

```

<Cube/>

or:

<LeastSquareError
    description="Visualizing the least square error on a set of data points."
/>

or:

<LineProblem/>

<LaserData/>

<MeasurementError/>

## Images


Using `Image` component I'm obliged to add a description xD:

```jsx
<Image
    src="/banner.png"
    description="Image description here"
/>
```

<Image
    src="/banner.png"
    description="Just a description with markdown and $\LaTeX$ support."
/>

## Mathematical Notation

It is well known that if you want to create math-heavy content, it is best to use LaTeX. So one of the problem of writing LaTeX with markdown is that [Commonmark Spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/) (the Markdown specification) does not support it, but thankfully most Markdown processors such as [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark), specifically with [remark-math](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math), allow you to process symbols such as `$` for inline math and `$$` for math blocks, which can then be processed by a LaTeX parser such as [Katex](https://katex.org/) with [`rehype-katex`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/tree/main/packages/rehype-katex) or [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) using [`rehype-mathjax`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/tree/main/packages/rehype-mathjax). These notes make use of `rehype-katex` to render equations.

### Problem: Consistency

One of my main concerns about the equations in the notes was the consistency of the notation. For exmaple if you want to write a vector you could do: $\mathbf{v}$ (`\mathbf{v}`), or $\vec{v}$ (`\vec{v}`), or $\tilde{v}$ (`\tilde{v}`), or $\overline{v}$ (`\overline{v}`). This seems very risky to me, because it opens up the possibility of inconsistency when writing equations, so to simplify things I have a set the **global macros** (across all notes) that are intended to make the job of writing equations more consistent and less verbose; for example in the vector case there are many macros that in dependence on the vector, I can do $\vv$ (`\vv`) or if it is the vector $\va$ (`\va`).

Just as historical note: At some point, I considered using `\v{a}` as the macro definition, but I realized that it introduces more visual noise compared to `\va`.

Some of the custom macros (see `CONST.ts` for all):
- Scalar: $a$ (integer or real) (`a`)
- Vector: $\va$ (`\va`)
- Matrix: $\mA$ (`\mA`)
- Tensor $\tA$ (`\tA`)

### Problem: Cross-references

Let's assume that I write this equation:

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

Now, if I want to add a reference to the equation number, I would have to write the following:

```plain
\begin{equation}
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
\end{equation}
```

which renders as:

$$
\begin{equation}
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
\label{demoequation}
\end{equation}
$$

Look at that nice looking equation number. You can use `\begin{equation}` or `\begin{align}` to get the equation number.

Something to note is that cross-referencing to the equation number is not functional out-of-the-box. Historically, theses notes used `Katex`, but currently we use `Temml`, which is similar in API but with `\label{...}`, `\ref{...}` and `\eqref{...}` implemented. These commands have not been implemented in Katex for years. See the open discussion on it:
- [Support \eqref and \label - Github](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/issues/2003).
- [Equation numbering - Github](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/issues/350)
- [Yet another request for equation reference - Github](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/issues/2798)

With [`Temml`](https://temml.org/), you can cross-reference an equation: $\eqref{demoequation}$, using standard latex command `\eqref{...}`.

Project with working solutions for this are:
- ✅ [MyST](https://mystmd.org/guide/math#one-liner): I like the way how you can hover on the cross-reference and it would display the equation as a pop-up.
    - They have a spec: [MyST Specification](https://mystmd.org/spec/)
- ✅ [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#equations): It also offers the same capabilities as MyST.
    - built on top of [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), get `.qmd` -> compile -> `<output format>`, it can be `HTML`, `PDF` or others.

Please note that I have not conducted an exhaustive search on this topic. I am familiar with these projects, and they have been a great inspiration for the way these notes are presented.

### Equation Component

`Equation` component:
```jsx
<Equation 
    formula="f(x) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}" 
    description="Just a description"
/>
```

<Equation 
    formula="f(x) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + \evh" 
    description="Just a description with markdown and $\LaTeX$ support."
/>

## Useful Component

One veryuseful component is the `<Description>` component. It allows to create a definition block:

```plain
<Definition term="A term">
This a free space for the whole block. Sure you can do, **markdown** and $LaTeX$ in here.
</Definition>
```

That renders as:

<Definition term="A term">
    This a free space for the whole block. Sure you can do, **markdown** and $\LaTeX$ in here.
</Definition>


<Demo>
    Hey what if i can just writ markdown here. "hey" 'hey'

    list:
    - skajdl
    - slakjda

    Equations:

    $$
    e^{i\pi} -1 = 0
    $$

</Demo>

## Embedding Diagrams

To create diagram I like to use [Drawio](https://www.draw.io/). The problem I have always faced is that if I want to change something in the diagram or I'm constantly doing modifications, I always have to export the diagram in some format like `jpg`,`png` or `svg` and during the process I have to make sure to use the same name and format of the previous file to overwrite it with the new one, and I know, it sounds simple but it becomes tedious, for that reason I created the `Drawio` component to embed the diagram file directly in the notes (no more annoying exports), plus you get a online interactive version of it.

When many diagrams are produced the way I always organize them in a Drawio file `.drawio` containing "pages" in it, and each page is a different diagram.

IMPORTANT: All diagrams should be placed in the `resources` folder inside `src/resources`.

```plain
<Drawio 
    file="test.drawio"
    page="1"
    description="Here you can describe the diagram"
/>
```

<Drawio 
    file="test.drawio"
    page="1"
    description="Here you can describe the diagram"
/>

<Drawio 
    file="test.drawio"
    page="2"
/>

## Things that I do not Like

- Footnotes: In short, they are simply not as good as they seem. For a more detailed explanation, see [Give footnotes the boot by Jake Archibald](https://jakearchibald.com/2025/give-footnotes-the-boot/), I completely share his vision and I also "I hate footnotes".
