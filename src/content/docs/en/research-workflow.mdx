## How to Read

How to read:
- ✨ Some researchers from different fields comment on their process [How to (seriously) read a scientific paper](https://www.science.org/content/article/how-seriously-read-scientific-paper)
- ✨ [How to Read a Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1273445.1273458) by S. Keshav David R. Cheriton
- [Ten simple rules for reading a scientific paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7392212/) by Carey MA, Steiner KL, Petri WA Jr.

### The First Pass

Steps:
1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction.
2. Read the section and sub-section headings and take a quick look at the figures and tables.
3. Read the conclusions.
4. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you’ve already read.

### The Second Pass (around a hour)

1. Look carefully at the figures
    - Are the axes properly labeled?
    - Are results shown with error bars
    - conclusions are statistically significant?
2. Mark relevant unread references for further reading

### The Third Pass

To fully understand a paper (attempt to virtually re-implement the paper):
- Requires great attention to detail.
- Pinpoint implicit assumptions
- Missing citations to relevant work
- Discussion compared to other methods
- Open-ended research questions

## How to Design Experiments

The Design of experiments (DOE): 
- [Designing Simulation Experiments](https://informs-sim.org/wsc13papers/includes/files/029.pdf)

## How to Write

How to write:
- ✨✨ [The Elements of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style) by Strunk and White. This is a general book on the rules of the English language that helps to improve writing style.
- ✨ [Whitesides’ Group: Writing a Paper](https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~rlake/Whitesides_writing_res_paper.pdf) by George. M. Whitesides
- ✨ [Writing Technical Articles](https://researchswinger.org/others/writing-schulz.pdf) by H. Schulzrinne. Focus on computer science and electrical engineering, systems and networks.

From [Whitesides’ Group: Writing a Paper](https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~rlake/Whitesides_writing_res_paper.pdf):
- Create a Outline (define the story to tell), to organize the structure:
    - objetive
    - hypotheses
    - conclusions
- Questions to answer in the outline:
    - Why did I do this work?
    - What does it mean?
    - What hypotheses did I mean to test?
    - What ones did I actually test?
    - What were the results?
- Content of the outline
    1. Title
    2. Authors
    3. Abstract (Do not write an abstract)
    4. Introduction
        - Objetives
        - Justification
        - Background
        - Guidance to the reader
        - Summary/conclusions
        - Sections and sub-sections (in advanced revisions of the outline)
    5. Results and Discussion
    6. Conclusions
    7. Experimental
- Style notes:
    - *"this"* + noun (always)
    - Use **active voice**
    - Complete all comparisons: E.g. "The yield was higher using bromine **than chlorine**."


From [Writing Technical Articles](https://researchswinger.org/others/writing-schulz.pdf) by H. Schulzrinne.
- There are four types of technical results:
    - An algorithm
    - A system construct; hardware, software, protocols, etc.
    - A performance evaluation
    - A theory
- A paper should focus on (one to one copy from the document):
    - Describing the results in sufficient details to establish their validity.
    - Identifying the novel aspects of the results, i.e., what new knowledge is reported and what makes it non-obvious.
    - Identifying the significance of the results: what improvements and impact do they suggest.

### Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research

1. For EVERY result, keep track of how it was produced.
    - pre-processing
    - post processing
    - very detail that may influence the execution of the step is recorded
    - If is software include name and version of the software
2. Avoid manual data manipulation steps
    - operations like the use of copy and paste between documents should also be avoided
3. Archive the exact version of all external programs used
4. Version control all custom scripts
5. Record all intermediate results, when possible in standardized formats
6. For analysis that include randomness, note underlying random seeds
7. Always store raw data behind plots
8. Generate hierarchical analysis Output, allowing layers of increasing detail to be inspected
9. Connect textual statements to underlying results
10. Provide public access to scripts, runs, and results
