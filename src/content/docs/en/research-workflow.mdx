### The First Pass

Steps:
1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction.
2. Read the section and sub-section headings and take a quick look at the figures and tables.
3. Read the conclusions.
4. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you’ve already read.

### The Second Pass (around a hour)

1. Look carefully at the figures
    - Are the axes properly labeled?
    - Are results shown with error bars
    - conclusions are statistically significant?
2. Mark relevant unread references for further reading

### The Third Pass

To fully understand a paper (attempt to virtually re-implement the paper):
- Requires great attention to detail.
- Pinpoint implicit assumptions
- Missing citations to relevant work
- Discussion compared to other methods
- Open-ended research questions

### Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research

1. For EVERY result, keep track of how it was produced.
    - pre-processing
    - post processing
    - very detail that may influence the execution of the step is recorded
    - If is software include name and version of the software
2. Avoid manual data manipulation steps
    - operations like the use of copy and paste between documents should also be avoided
3. Archive the exact version of all external programs used
4. Version control all custom scripts
5. Record all intermediate results, when possible in standardized formats
6. For analysis that include randomness, note underlying random seeds
7. Always store raw data behind plots
8. Generate hierarchical analysis Output, allowing layers of increasing detail to be inspected
9. Connect textual statements to underlying results
10. Provide public access to scripts, runs, and results
