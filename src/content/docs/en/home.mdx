**What is this website?**; Most, if not all, of my notes are a humble and well-intentioned attempt to bring formalism closer to intuition, rigorous (within my personal limitations) but approachable, covering concepts and topics primarily for my own edification, and although this may seem egocentric, I make them public with the hope that they can serve as a resource for anyone else.

**Disclaimer**: Think about this website as *rummaging* through my (virtual) notebook; therefore, some notes may be chaotic --just ideas-- and others may be fully structured and polished.

Ohh, I almost forgot to mention, there is no navigation system :)... it just make thing more interesting to explore on trying to find stuff.

If you have the curiosity to know how this came to be, feel free to check [this](this).
