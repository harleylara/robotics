The reality is that creating quality content in any format is a huge effort.

## Backstage

Being close to, and immersed in, an educational environment, simultaneously acting as both a "transmitter" and a "receiver”, I have experienced firsthand the benefits and shortcomings of both. Clearly, this is nothing new; many teachers were students in the formal sense, and I say "in the formal sense" because even if you are a teacher, you always have to be learning and keeping up to date with new technologies.

**Transmitter viewpoint:**

One of the biggest challenges a teacher can face is preparing course material, which includes slides, homework assignments, and possibly labs. Of course, there are many resources available on the internet and in local university libraries to help prepare content, but the most critical part is not collecting these resources, but rather shaping them according to **"local constraints"**, which can range from technological needs to social democratic or educational background.

Of course, all educational institutions have something equivalent to a handbook or syllabus, from which some teachers can derive the structure and content of the course.

In the best-case scenario, a teacher uses the content of the course and the teaching material to bridges the gap between the needs of local and international industry so that students are ultimately prepared to face the challenges of the industry.

The problem is that the handbook is often a couple of years out of date, and there is also a gap between when you take the class and when you graduate....

## The Idea

- Why taking notes

Clearly I'm not the first person with a view on this, for example [My Vision for Online Education by Jannis Conen](https://www.jannisconen.com/stories/my-vision-for-online-education).

## History Repeats

- [Just what is TeX?](https://tug.org/whatis.html)
    - [Why TeX?](https://ctan.org/tex?lang=en)
    - [Knuth on designing and implementing TeX - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emmBqIO46Qg) by Turing Awardee Clips

TeX was designed to convert from TeX -> [DVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_independent_file_format)

Markdown:
- [Markdown by John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

Markdown was designed to convert from Markdown -> HTML

## The Philosophy

Legibility: "Optimal legibility is achieved if the typographical factors, like size of type and leading, together make an easy and rapid reading with comprehension (Tinker, 1963)."
- typeface
- size
- leading

this is only effective if improves comprehension.

## Influences

The following is a list of people I came across over the years while working on this notes, people who inspired me and helped shape my sense of what high-quality content looks like:
- [Bartosz Ciechanowski's](https://ciechanow.ski/)
- The (digital for now Jan. 2026) book [Making Software](https://www.makingsoftware.com/) by [Dan Hollick](https://typefully.com/DanHollick).
- [How does image compression work?](https://leerob.com/compression) by [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.com/)
- [All color is best-effort](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/all-color-is-best-effort) by [Amos, better known as fasterthanlime](https://fasterthanli.me/about)
- [254A, Notes 0: A review of probability theory](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/275a-notes-0-foundations-of-probability-theory/) by [Terence Tao](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/)
- [Annotated History of Modern AI and Deep Learning](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-history.html) by [https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/](Jürgen Schmidhuber)

## The Research (tech)

Hunting for a stack.

- The medium, why online, why as a website? why astro?

For a long time I've watend to have a personal documentation website equipped with all sorts of tools to make the content more engaging and interactive, but without shooting myself in the foot with complicated markup languages and long editing time. So after years trying out different platforms, frameworks, libraries and markups I realize that I love the simplicity of `markdown`, but for those features it falls short in interactivity and modularity (and that's fine), but I would love to have the option of defining more dynamic content. At that point it comes into play [`MDX`](https://mdxjs.com/), as they say "Markdown for the component era".

Ok, problem solved (really?). Clearly the decision to use MDX is just the tip of the iceberg, there are still other problems to deal with, such as file-based routing, multi-language support, integrations, bundling, asset handling, optimizations and more, I even considered at the time *"Should I write such a framework?"*, after a couple of days thinking about it I came across [`Astro`](https://astro.build/) (version 1.0 rc had just been pre-released - July 26 2022), it was love at first sight, I still remember the level of excitement that grew more and more as I read about its features, since then I have been experimenting with it and it is just perfect.

**In a nutshell**, this site is powered by [Astro](https://astro.build/) and some amazing integrations.

## The Execution

This note is simply a discursse of the ideas behind why this are the way they are in this website.

- Stay focus
