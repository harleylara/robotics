## [1943] A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity

Warren Sturgis McCulloch:
- American neurophysiologist

Walter Pitts:
- self-taught logician. Source: [McCulloch & Pitts Publish the First Mathematical Model of a Neural Network](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=782)


Concepts:
- [All-or-none law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-or-none_law): The nerve fibre either gives a maximal response or none at all.

Facts:
- "[...] including the Principia conventions for dots."
