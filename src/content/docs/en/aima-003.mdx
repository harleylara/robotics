Exogenous: event that happens.

## Search Problem

Problems types:
- Deterministic, fully observable -> classical search problems
- Non-observable -> the agent may have not idea where it is
- Non-deterministic and/or partial observable

A search problem can be defined formally as follows:
- A set of possible **states** that the environment can be in. This is called **state space**.
- The **initial state**.
- A set of **one** or **more goals**.
- The actions available, given a state “s” `ACTIONS(s)` return a finite set of actions that can be executed for the current state “s”.
- A transition model describes what each action does. `RESULT(s, a)` returns the state that results from doing action “a” in state “s”
- An action cost function, which for a given function `ACTION-COST(s, a, s’)` returns a numeric cost of performing action “a” in state “s” to reach state “s’ ”. It needs to reflect its own performance measure.

## Tree Search

Tree search algorithms: Basic idea, offline, simulated exploration of state space.

Tree-search(problem, strategy) return a solution or a failure
	Init the search tree with the initial state of “problem”

	Loop do:
		If there are no candidates for expansion then, return failure
		
		Chose a leaf node for expansion based on “strategy”

		If the node contains a goal state, return solution
		Else expand the current node and add the resulting nodes to the search tree
End


State vs. Node
- **State*8 is a representation of the environment configuration
- **Node**, is a data structure that contains state, parent, children, if its expanded it also includes depth and cost
- **Node expansion**: based on the transition model RESULT(s, a) generated the states of the children.

## Search Strategies

Search strategies:
- Its defined by picking the order of node EXPANSION

Ways to evaluate a search strategy:
- **completeness**: does it ALWAYS find a solution, if there is any
- **optimality**: does it always find a least-cost solution
- **time complexity**: number of nodes generated/expanded
- **space complexity**: MAXIMUM  number of nodes in memory

## State Space

State spaces:
- Finite state space
- Infinite state space
- Acyclic state space
- Cyclic state space

## Uniformed Search

What is uniformed search? An uninformed search algorithm is given no clue about how close a state is to the goal(s). Uninformed strategies use only the information available in the problem definition.

[Solving problems by searching interactive diagrams](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-javascript/3-Solving-Problems-By-Searching/)

Uninformed search strategies:
- Breadth-first search: Expand shallowest unexpanded node, using a FIFO queue.
- Dijkstra’s algorithm or uniform-cost search
- Depth-first search: always expands the deepest node in the frontier first., using LIFO queue.
- Depth-limited search: 
- Iterative deepening search

### Breadth-first Search (BFS)

The root node is expanded first, then all the successors of the root node are expanded next, then their successors, and so on. This is a systematic search strategy that is therefore **complete** even on **infinite state spaces**.

The evaluation function for BFS is $f(n) = d$ where $d$ is the node depth assuming a $cost=1$ per step.

## Informed (Heuristic) Search

Informed search: One that uses *domain-specific hints* about the location of goals and can find solutions more efficiently than an uninformed strategy.

<Equation
    formula="h(n)"
    description="**Heuristic function**: estimated cost of the **cheapest path** from the state at node `n` to a goal state."
/>


Informed search strategies:
- Greedy search
- A*
- Interactive-deepeaning A* (IDA*)
- Recursive best-first search (RBFS)
- Bidirectional search
- Beam search
- Weighted A∗

### Greedy search

*"A form of best-first search that expands first the node with lowest $h(n)$ value (the node that appears to be closest to the goal) on the grounds that this is likely to lead to a solution quickly. So the evaluation function $f (n) = h(n)$."* from section 3.5.1 of AIMA Book

### A*

The original paper of A* [A Formal Basis for the Heuristic Determination of Minimum Cost Paths (Hart et al., 1968)](https://ai.stanford.edu/~nilsson/OnlinePubs-Nils/PublishedPapers/astar.pdf)
The most common informed search algorithm is A* search (pronounced “A-star search”), a best-first search that uses the evaluation function:

$$
f (n) = g(n) + h(n)
$$

- $g(n)$ is the **actual** cost of an optimal path from $s$ to $n$,
- $h(n)$ is the **actual** cost of an optimal path from $n$ to a preferred goal node of $n$.

So we have $f(n)$ = estimated cost of the best path that continues from n to a goal.

Side node: A* was develop for [Shakey](https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/artificial-intelligence-robotics/13/289), consider "the first mobile robot with the ability to perceive and reason about its surroundings."

#### Proof Admissibility of A*

<Definition term="Admissibility">
We call an algorithm *admissible* if it is guaranteed to find a **optimal path** from $n$ to a preferred goal node of $n$ for any $\epsilon$ graph.

</Definition>

The valuation function on A*:

$$
f^*(n) = g^*(n) + h^*(n)
$$

Consider:
- $g^*(n)$: is the cost of the path from $s$ (start) to $n$ with minimum cost so far found by A*
- $h^*(n)$: is any estimate of the cost of an optimal path from $n$ to a preferred goal node of $n$.

**Lemma 1**:  For any nonclosed node $n$ and optimal path $P$ from $s$ to $n$, there exists an $\textrm{OPEN}$ node $n'$ on $P$ with $g^*(n') = g(n')$.

**Proof**:
- Case 1 (trivial) $s$ node is $\textrm{OPEN}$: Let us assume that the initial node $s$ is $\textrm{OPEN}$, which implies that A* has not performed any iteration, so the open node $n'$ in $P=(s)$ is $s$ - $s=n'$- in this case the lemma is trivially true since $g^*(s)=g(s)=0$.
- Case 2 $s$ is $\textrm{CLOSED}$: Let us assume that $s$ is $\textrm{CLOSED}$ and let $\Delta$ be the set of all $\textrm{CLOSED}$ nodes $n_i$ in $P$ for which $g^*(n_i) = g(n_i)$. Let $n^*$ be the element of $\Delta$ with the highest index. Clearly, $n^* \neq n$ as $n$ is $\textrm{OPEN}$.
