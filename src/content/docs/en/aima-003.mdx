Exogenous: event that happens.

Problems types:
- Deterministic, fully observable -> classical search problems
- Non-observable -> the agent may have not idea where it is
- Non-deterministic and/or partial observable

A search problem can be defined formally as follows:
- A set of possible states that the environment can be in. This is called state space.
- The initial state
- A set of one or more goals
- The actions available, given a state “s” ACTIONS(s) return a finite set of actions that can be executed for the current state “s”.
- A transition model describes what each action does. RESULT(s, a) returns the state that results from doing action “a” in state “s”
- An action cost function, which for a given function ACTION-COST(s, a, s’) returns a numeric cost of performing action “a” in state “s” to reach state “s’ ”. It needs to reflect its own performance measure.

Tree search algorithms: Basic idea, offline, simulated exploration of state space.

Tree-search(problem, strategy) return a solution or a failure
	Init the search tree with the initial state of “problem”

	Loop do:
		If there are no candidates for expansion then, return failure
		
		Chose a leaf node for expansion based on “strategy”

		If the node contains a goal state, return solution
		Else expand the current node and add the resulting nodes to the search tree
End


State vs. Node
- **State*8 is a representation of the environment configuration
- **Node**, is a data structure that contains state, parent, children, if its expanded it also includes depth and cost
- **Node expansion**: based on the transition model RESULT(s, a) generated the states of the children.

Search strategies:
- Its defined by picking the order of node EXPANSION

Ways to evaluate a search strategy:
- **completeness**: does it ALWAYS find a solution, if there is any
- **optimality**: does it always find a least-cost solution
- **time complexity**: number of nodes generated/expanded
- **space complexity**: MAXIMUM  number of nodes in memory


State spaces:
- Finite state space
- Infinite state space
- Acyclic state space
- Cyclic state space


What is uninformed search? An uninformed search algorithm is given no clue about how close a state is to the goal(s). Uninformed strategies use only the information available in the problem definition.


Uninformed search strategies:
- Breadth-first search: Expand shallowest unexpanded node, using a FIFO queue.
- Dijkstra’s algorithm or uniform-cost search
- Depth-first search: always expands the deepest node in the frontier first., using LIFO queue.
- Depth-limited search: 
- Iterative deepening search
