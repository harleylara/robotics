## The CPU evolution (super brief)

from 1MHz to 1 to 4 GHz.
- the clock speed is not the only way to get more performance, but it has always been a reliable source for improved performance.
- power limitation
- heat restrictions
- physical limit to transistor size

add more cores....

## The Born of the GPU

GPU: Graphics processing unit

In the early 1990s: *"These display accelerators offered hardware-assisted bitmap operations to assist in the display and usability of graphical operating systems."*

1992: OpenGL library

mid 1990s: The game industry with games like Doom

2001: NVIDIA’s release of the GeForce 3

add this point the APIs for GPUs where mainly focus on rendering and graphics, no in general-purpose computation. *"In essence, the GPU was being tricked into performing nonrendering tasks by making those tasks appear as if they were a standard rendering."*
- lacking the ability to write to arbitrary locations in memory (scatter)
- *"it was nearly impossible to predict how your particular GPU would deal with floating-point data, if it handled floating-point data at all")*

So at this point in time the only way to interact with the GPU was using OpenGL or DirectX.

In November 2006: the GeForce 8800 GTX, 
- first DirectX 10 GPU
- first GPU to be built with NVIDIA's CUDA Architecture

WHAT THE HECK IS THE CUDA Architecture (not the API)?
- unified shader pipeline
- comply with IEEE requirements for single-precision floating-point arithmetic
- instruction set tailored for general computation (more generic that just for graphics)
- allowed arbitrary read and write access to memory
- software-managed cache known as **shared memory**

you still need to use OpenGL's GLSL or Microsoft's HLSL shader language.

*"A few months after the launch of the GeForce 8800 GTX, NVIDIA made public a compiler for this language, CUDA C"*... (but you are required to have a driver to talk to the GPU)

## Getting Started

Prerequisites:
- A CUDA-enabled graphics processor: Since 2008 all NVIDIA's GPUs are CUDA-enabled, but over the year they have different feature sets.
- An NVIDIA device driver
- A CUDA development toolkit: this contains NVIDIA's compiler for the GPU code
- A standard C compiler

`host`: CPU and the system’s memory as the host
`device`: GPU and its memory

A `function` that executes on the `device` is typically called a `kernel`.

INSERT THE CODE DEMO HERE

- CUDA C adds the `__global__` **qualifier** to standard C. *"This mechanism alerts the compiler that a function should be compiled to run on a device instead of the host."*
- The angle brackets denote arguments to pass to the runtime system.

## Querying Devices

Check for CUDA devices and **capabilities** (or "Compute Capabilities")
