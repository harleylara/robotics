## Linear Regression

<Equation>
    $$
    y(\vx, \vw) = w_0 + w_1 x_1 + \dots + w_D x_D
    $$
    Linear regresion model.
</Equation>

<Equation>
    $$
    y(\vx) = w x + b
    $$

    Simple linear model.
</Equation>

<LinearModel>
    Linear model.
</LinearModel>

<NonLinearModel>
    Linear model trying to fit a set of non-linear sample points.
</NonLinearModel>

<Think>
    How can we use linear models to aproximate non-linear data?

### Likelihood Functions

<Definition term="Likelihood Function">
Is the joint probability mass (or probability density) of observed data viewed as a function of the parameters of a statistical model.
