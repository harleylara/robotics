## Basic Concepts and Terminology

### System

<Definition term="System">
    Interconnections of elements and devices for a desired purpose.

    Source: Modern Control System 13th edition by Richard C. Dorf and Robert H. Bishop
</Definition>

<Definition term="System">
A control system consists of subsystems and processes (or plants) assembled for the purpose of obtaining a **desired output** with **desired performance**, given a **specified input**.

</Definition>

Other definition,

<Definition term="System">
A system is a combination of components that act together and perform a certain objective. A system need not be physical. The concept of the system can be applied to abstract, dynamic phenomena such as those encountered in economics. The word system should, therefore, be interpreted to imply physical, biological, economic, and the like, systems.

/>

This set of *devices/components/elements* could be **sensors** and **actuators** for example.

### Plant

<Definition term="Plan">
A plant may be a piece of equipment, perhaps just a set of machine parts functioning together, the purpose of which is to perform a particular operation.

</Definition>

Any controllable device or object can be referred to as a plant.

### Process

Ogata refers to "process" as any operation to be controlled.

### Disturbances

<Definition term="Disturbances">
A disturbance is a signal that tends to **adversely** affect the value of the output of a system. If a disturbance is generated within the system, it is called *internal*, while an *external* disturbance is generated outside the system and is an input."

### Sensor

<Definition term="Sensor">
Device that receives and responds to a signal or stimulus.

Source: Handbook of modern sensors: physics, designs, and applications by Jacob Fraden
</Definition>


<Definition term="Sensor">
A sensor is a device that receives a physical, chemical, or biological stimulus and responds with a quantification of this stimulus in the form of a signal that can be interpreted, transmitted and/or stored.

### Actuator

<Definition term="Actuator">
An actuator is a device that converts energy (typically electrical, hydraulic, or pneumatic)

### Transform Requirements Into a Physical System

### Draw a Functional Block Diagram

### Identify the Variables to be Controlled

- Space station orientation and control moment gyro momentum.
- Mean arterial pressure.
- UAV vertical position

### Create a Schematic

<Drawio
    file="control-001.drawio"
    page="8"
    description="Schematic diagrams for different disciplines. Each diagram is used to illustrate the dynamics of a feedback system."
/>

### Develop a (Mathematical) Model

- Block Diagrams
- Modelling from Experiments

<Drawio
    file="control-001.drawio"
    page="9"
    description="Standard block diagram elements. The arrows indicate the the inputs and outputs of each element, with the mathematical operation corresponding to the blocked labeled at the output."
/>

### Reduce the Model

By mathematical modelling you can reduce blocks.

### Analyze and Design

In this phase, the engineer analyzes the system to see if the response specifications and performance requirements can be met by simple adjustments of system parameters.

Types of responses:
- impulse
- step
- ramp
- sinusoidal

- MATLAB and simulink (for model-based design)
- LabView
- Python
