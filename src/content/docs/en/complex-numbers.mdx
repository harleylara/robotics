Sadly, complex numbers seem to allude to being difficult to understand or complicated, however it is just an unfortunate name.

These notes explore a little of the history and origin of complex numbers, and if possible better explore the inner beauty of this representation.



## The "Imaginary" numbers

Thanks to Rene Descartes, today we call them imaginary numbers, curiously enough he referred to them with a derogatory term.

Note: Note: keep in mind that depending on the discipline, the $\sqrt{-1}$ can be denoted with a different symbol, for example in electrical engineering $\sqrt{-1}=j$ is used since $i$ has a very well established meaning in the field (in this case current).

What is the square root of $16$? $\sqrt{16}$
- the answer is: $4$, $4 \times 4 = \sqrt{16}$, and $-4$, $-4 \times -4 = \sqrt{16}$

what's going on here? $\sqrt{-1} \sqrt{-1} = -1$
- re-write: $i \times i = -1$, or $i^2 = -1$
