If you are wondering:

> Do I need to learn to ROS 1 to be able to learn ROS 2 (or vice versa), the answer is NO. (what? you expected a more elaborated answer?... I'm to lazy to write it down)

## What is ROS and Why use it?

ROS: "The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications" (from the official [website](https://www.ros.org/))

ROS is:
- Plumbing
- Tools
- Capabilities
- Ecosystem

### Plumbing

- Execution models
    - Iterative execution
    - Event-oriented execution
- Communication paradigms
    - Publication/Subscription (asynchronous)
    - Services (synchronous)
    - Actions (asynchronous)
- Drivers

### Tools

- logging/plotting
- (Communication) graph visualization
- diagnostics
- visualization
- simulation

### Capabilities

- Perception
- Navigation
- Manipulation
- Path planning
- more...

### ROS Ecosystem: [map](http://metrorobots.com/rosmap.html)

- Schools
