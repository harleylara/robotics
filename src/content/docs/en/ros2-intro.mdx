If you are wondering:

> Do I need to learn to ROS 1 to be able to learn ROS 2 (or vice versa), the answer is NO. (what? you expected a more elaborated answer?... I'm to lazy to write it down)

## Communication Paradigms

- Publication/Subscription (asynchronous)
- Services (synchronous)
- Actions (asynchronous)

## Execution Model

- Iterartive execution
- Event-oriented execution

## Names in ROS 2

Names can be:
- relative path
- absolute path (begins with `\`)
- privately (begins with `~`)
- namespace

External resources:
- [ROS 1 Names](http://wiki.ros.org/Names)
- [ROS 2 Topic and Service name mapping to DDS](https://design.ros2.org/articles/topic_and_service_names.html)
- [ROS conventions](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Patterns/Conventions)

### The Workspace

The workspace contains:
- Packages
    - Executables
    - Libraries
    - Message definitions
- Meta-Packages: a package containing other packages
    - [Metapackages ROS 1](http://wiki.ros.org/Metapackages)

Workspace activation is accumulative.

### Packages

They can be installed from source or with the system instalation system.

```
ros-<distro>-<ros-2-package-name>
```

### Building a Workspace

```
colcon build --symlink-install
```

The option `--symlink-install` creates a symlink to their original locations instead of copying.

This will create a three folders:
- `build`
- `install`
- `log`

`colcon` (collective construction)

## ROS 2 - CLI

```
ros2 <command> <verb> [<params>|<options>]*
```

To get a list of available packages:
```
ros2 pkg list
```

External resources:
- [ROS 2 CLI cheatsheet](https://github.com/ubuntu-robotics/ros2_cheats_sheet/blob/master/cli/cli_cheats_sheet.pdf)

To run a node:
```
ros2 run <package-name> <node-name>
```
