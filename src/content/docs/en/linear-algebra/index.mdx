## Historical Notes

- Ancient China – The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (Chapter Eight: Rectangular Arrays): Early methods for solving systems of linear equations appeared in this ancient Chinese mathematical text.
- 1664 – René Descartes: Introduced an analytical view of geometry using algebra, giving rise to Cartesian geometry.
- 1693 – Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz: Developed systematic methods for solving linear systems using determinants.
- 1750 – Gabriel Cramer: Formulated what is now known as Cramer’s Rule for solving linear systems.
- Carl Friedrich Gauss: Popularized Gaussian elimination as a method for solving systems of linear equations.
- 1843 – William Rowan Hamilton: Introduced quaternions, expanding the concept of numbers to higher dimensions.
- 1844 – Hermann Grassmann ✨: Developed foundational ideas that led to modern linear algebra in his work Die Lineale Ausdehnungslehre.
  - @grassmannAusdehnungslehre1844Oder1878
  - @grassmannNewBranchMathematics1995
  - Review: @lawvereReviewHermannGunter2005
- 1848 – James Joseph Sylvester: Introduced the term matrix, derived from the Latin word for womb.
- 1856 – Arthur Cayley: Defined matrix multiplication and introduced the concept of the inverse matrix.
- 1888 – Giuseppe Peano: Provided the first modern and rigorous definition of a vector space.

From this point onward, the development of abstract algebra began, expanding mathematical structures beyond vector spaces to include groups, rings, and fields.

Although I would like to investigate further the ideas that gave rise to modern linear algebra, I don't have the time to do so at the moment. But here are some resources that may be interesting to explore later, for my future self:
