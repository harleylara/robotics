## Chapter 1

Thales of Miletus (c.625–547 bc) "Thales may have been the first to introduce this notion of proof" ... "but it seems to have been the Pythagoreans who first made important use of it to establish things that were not otherwise obvious."


"But what is a mathematical proof? A proof, in mathematics, is an impeccable argument, using only the methods of pure logical reasoning, which enables one to infer the validity of a given mathematical assertion from the pre-established validity of other mathematical assertions, or from some particular primitive assertions—the axioms—whose validity is taken to be self-evident. Once such a mathematical assertion has been established in this way, it is referred to as a theorem."
