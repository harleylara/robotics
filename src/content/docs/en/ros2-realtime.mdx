## What is real-time

Real-time is an ambiguous term used in multiple domains:
- Real-time delivery tracking
- Real-time clock
- Real-time visualizations
- Real-time operating systems
- Real-time applications

[Real-time computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing)

Some people classify it as:
- "soft"
- "hard"
- "firm"

But, other people argue that real-time has to strictly comply with the deadlines, just an arbritary example this video [Introduction to Realtime Linux](https://youtu.be/BKkX9WASfpI?t=424).

    note="Real-time is about determinism"

## Real-time in Robotics

Some applications:
- High frequency loops (aprox. 1000 Hz)
- Object detection and collision avoidance (aprox. 100 Hz)
