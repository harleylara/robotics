How did I get here?

ANS: In October 2024, me and [Rolf Becker](https://www.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/en/user/7254) (a good friend and my lab manager) were going to teach the class “CI_W.09 Control Engineering” in the bachelor's program [Infotronic Systems Engineering](https://www.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/de/fakultaeten/kommunikation-und-umwelt/studienangebot/bachelorstudiengaenge/infotronic-systems). As I was preparing class material for the topic of “Laplace transform” I realized how fascinating the ideas proposed by Pierre-Simon Laplace were and wanted to explore the historical context of how the ideas developed. This exploration led me to the bottom of this rabbit hole as follows: Laplace transform $\rightarrow$ Fourier transform $\rightarrow$ Fourier series $\rightarrow$ Euler's formula $\rightarrow$ imaginary unit and complex numbers $\rightarrow$ cubic equation.

After reading about the fascinating stories, people and ideas behind all the topics I decided to take the time and explore each of them, so here we are at the bottom of the rabbit hole.

Side note: due to time constraints I had to abandon my support in the control class, but the curiosity for the origin of the ideas remained in me.

## The (Modern) General Equation

<Equation>
    $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$

    General form of a **cubic equation** where $a$ is not zero.
</Equation>

"The solutions of this equation are called **roots** of the cubic function defined by the left-hand side of the equation. If all of the coefficients $a$, $b$, $c4, and $d$ of the cubic equation are **real numbers**, then it has at least one real root (this is true for all *odd-degree* polynomial functions)." from [Cubic Equation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_equation)

## Brief History

- Italian mathematician [Scipione del Ferro (1465–1526)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scipione_del_Ferro): Known for Solving the depressed cubic equation.
- [Niccolò Tartaglia (1500–1557)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolo_Tartaglia)
- [Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerolamo_Cardano): "Complex numbers are [...] subtle as they are useless [...]"

## Properties

- least one real root (solution).
- A [inflection point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection_point).
- Is symmetric with respect to the inflection point. For [odd functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_and_odd_functions) $f(-x) = -f(x)$

for the equation $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$,

The first derivative $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$

The second derivative $f''(x) = 6ax + 2b$.

Solve for $x$. $6ax + 2b = 0$, give $x = -\frac{b}{3a}$
