## Names in ROS 2

Names can be:
- absolute path (begins with `/`): `/global/name`
- relative path: `relative/name`
- privately (begins with `~`): `~private/name`
- namespace: namespace prefix to apply to entities associated with the node (node name, topics, etc). `/namespace/name`, this is very useful to group nodes and topics by *"groups”* in this case the *“group”* is the prefix namespace.

## The Workspace

The concept of workspace is *ROS VERSION independent*, with this I mean that it doesn't matter if you are using ROS 1 or ROS 2, both use the workspace concept.

<Definition term="ROS workspace">
A workspace is a directory containing **ROS packages**.

Source: [Creating a workspace | Official documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html)
</Definition>

But, what is a ROS package?... more about it later (see [ROS Packages](ros2-pkgs)), for now just think about a box/package with some code, configs and more in it, trust me.

The workspace contains:
- Packages contains:
    - Executables
    - Libraries
    - Message definitions
    - Config files and more
- Meta-Packages (ROS 1 concept): a package containing other packages
    - [Metapackages ROS 1](http://wiki.ros.org/Metapackages)
    - In ROS 2 there is no **explicit** type of package know as "meta-package"

### Underlay

<Definition term="Underlay workspace">
It contains the necessary dependencies of all the packages required by the 'overlay'.

Source: [Configuring environment | Official documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Configuring-ROS2-Environment.html)
</Definition>

    Underlay workspace.
</Drawio>

Let's explore our underlay workspace: `/opt/ros/humble/`

<Important>
    Keep in mind that an underlay does not necessarily have to be the main ROS 2 installation.
</Important>

### Overlay

<Definition term="Overlay workspace">
Extends the underlay. (You will normally work here).

Source: [Configuring environment | Official documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Configuring-ROS2-Environment.html)
</Definition>

Note, that for some reason unknown to me, the terms "underlay" and "overlay" are not frequently used in the ROS community. The vast majority of people when they refer to workspace it is usually the overlay workspace.

## Create a Workspace

Create a overlay workspace is simple as creating a folder using the `mkdir` `bash` command. Just keep in mind that this folder MUST contain a `src` folder inside. Inside the `src` folder your packages will live.

<Terminal
    title="create a workspace"
    content="mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src \
    cd ~/ros2_ws"
/>

## Building a Workspace

The build tool in ROS 2 is called `colcon` (collective construction). colcon is an iteration on the ROS build tools `catkin_make`, `catkin_make_isolated`, `catkin_tools` and `ament_tools`. `colcon` compile, test and install packages for you. `colcon` internally uses build systems depending on the type of package to compile or test, [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for C++ packages and [setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html) for python.

Open a new terminal and try to run the following commands:

<Terminal
    title="build workspace"
    content="cd ~/ros2_ws \
    colcon build --symlink-install"
/>

Failure? Why? hint: the `ament_cmake` is a ROS package that is currently not available.

The option `--symlink-install` creates a symlink to their original locations instead of copying.

This will create a three folders:
- `build`
- `install`
- `log`

<Important>
    You should always run the build command from the ROOT of the workspace.

## Source a Workspace (Activate it)

**Workspace activation (source)** is accumulative.

Don't forget to source your underlay in EVERY terminal you open.

<Terminal
    title="source underlay"
    content="source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash"
/>

<Terminal
    title="source overlay"
    content="source install/local_setup.bash"
/>

External reference on sourcing [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html#source-the-overlay)

What is the diference on `setup.bash` in the underlay an `local_setup.bash` in the overlay?

- `setup.bash` in the underlay under `/opt/ros/<DISTO>/setup.bash` enables all the packages in the underlay.
- `local_setup.bash` in the overlay under (usually) `~/<YOUR WORKSPACE>/install/local_setup.bash` enables the ONLY the current workspace.
- `setup.bash` in the overlay under `~/<YOUR WORKSPACE>/install/setup.bash` enables the current workspace as well as the underlay it was created in.

<Important>
    You may need to re-source the workspace after adding new packages.
</Important>

## Sourcing Tips

If you want to automate the process of sourcing the underlaying workspace you can use the power of bash in linux:

<Terminal
    title=""
    content="echo 'source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc"
/>

## Installing Dependencies

Managing dependencies:

<Terminal
    title="install dependencies with rosdep"
    content="rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro humble -y"
/>
