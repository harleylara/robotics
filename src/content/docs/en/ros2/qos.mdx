title: "Quality of Service (QoS)"

You combine QoS **policies** to make QoS **profile**

- History
    - Keep last: only store up to N samples, configurable via the queue depth option.
    - Keep all: store all samples, subject to the configured resource limits of the underlying middleware.
- Depth
    - Queue size: only honored if the “history” policy was set to “keep last”.
- Reliability
    - Best effort: attempt to deliver samples, but may lose them if the network is not robust.
    - Reliable: guarantee that samples are delivered, may retry multiple times.
- Durability
    - Transient local: the publisher becomes responsible for persisting samples for “late-joining” subscriptions.
    - Volatile: no attempt is made to persist samples.
- Deadline
    - Duration: the expected maximum amount of time between subsequent messages being published to a topic
- Lifespan
    - Duration: the maximum amount of time between the publishing and the reception of a message without the message being considered stale or expired (expired messages are silently dropped and are effectively never received).
- Liveliness
    - Automatic: the system will consider all of the node’s publishers to be alive for another “lease duration” when any one of its publishers has published a message.
    - Manual by topic: the system will consider the publisher to be alive for another “lease duration” if it manually asserts that it is still alive (via a call to the publisher API).
- Lease Duration
    - Duration: the maximum period of time a publisher has to indicate that it is alive before the system considers it to have lost liveliness (losing liveliness could be an indication of a failure).
