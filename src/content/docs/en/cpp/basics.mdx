## Variables

Types groups, from [Variables and types - Fundamental data types](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/variables/#fundamental):
- character types
- integer types (signed and unsigned)
- floating-point types
- boolean type
- void type
- null pointer

Variables initialization:
- [Default initialization](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/default_initialization): Just declaration
- [Copy initialization](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_initialization)
- [Aggregate initialization](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization)
- [Direct initialization](ttps://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/direct_initialization)

More about [initialization](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/initialization)

```cpp filename="var.cpp" remoteURL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harleylara/cpp-intro/master/002-basics/var.cpp"
```

More details on variables check [Variables and types - Fundamental data types](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/variables/#fundamental)

Harley's note: Is this a good moment to insert the concept of `const` and `constexpr`?

## Operators

Topics:
- assignment
- Arithmetic
- Increment and decrement
- "Compose" assignment (Note: Compose is a makeup by me (harley))
- Comparison
- Logical
- member access
- [Operator precedence](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence.html)

More details on [Operator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/expressions.html)

## Name Visibility

Topics:
- Scopes
- Namespaces
- `using`
- Namespaces aliasing
- The std namespace
- Storage classes

```cpp filename="visibility.cpp" remoteURL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harleylara/cpp-intro/master/002-basics/visibility.cpp"
```

## Conditions

[conditions demo](https://github.com/harleylara/cpp-intro/blob/master/002-basics/conditions.cpp):
- if
- else
- else if
- switch

```cpp filename="conditions.cpp" remoteURL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harleylara/cpp-intro/master/002-basics/conditions.cpp"
```

More details on conditions and flow check [Statements and flow control](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/control/)

## Loops

[lopp demo](https://github.com/harleylara/cpp-intro/blob/master/002-basics/loops.cpp):
- while
- do-while
- for (common)
- for-each (with type deduction)
- break

```cpp filename="loops.cpp" remoteURL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harleylara/cpp-intro/master/002-basics/loops.cpp"
```

## Functions

Topics:
- scopes
- functions with no type returned.
- functions declaration and function definition (actual implementation).
- functions with type returned.
- parameters:
    - by value
    - by reference (`&` as **alias** operator -- not address operator --)
    - `const`
- return values
- functions overload
    - default values
- function templates

```cpp filename="functions.cpp" remoteURL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harleylara/cpp-intro/master/002-basics/functions.cpp"
```

More details on [Functions](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/functions2/).

## Misc Data Types

Topics:
- type aliases (`typedef` and `using`)
- emuns
- unions

    - public vs. private
    - members initialization
    - getters and setters
- class methods (also known as member functions)
- constructor:
    - [initialization](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/value_initialization)

    - uniform initialization
- [Special members](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes2/)
    - Default constructor
    - Destructor
    - Copy constructor
    - Copy assignment
    - Move constructor
    - Move assignment
    - [The Rule of Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(C%2B%2B_programming))
- overloading operators (not this time)
- the keyword `this` (not this time)
- static members (not this time)
- const member functions (not this time)
- class templates (not this time)
- template specialization (not this time)

## Inheritance

## Pointers

<Important
    note="Don't be afraid."
/>

*If you are interested in pointers you can ask the organizers for an extra half session of C++.*

Topics:
- declaring pointers
- address-of operator
- dereferences operator
- pointers and arrays
- pointers initialization
- pointers arithmetics
- pointers const
- pointers string literals
- void pointers
- invalid pointers and null pointers
- pointers to functions


declaring pointers:
```cpp
int num;
int *ptr;

// The following declarations are  all equivalent:
// int* ptr;
// int * ptr;
// int *ptr;
// int*ptr;
```

address-of operators:
```cpp
int num = 4;
int *ptr = &num;

// pi = num; // address <--x--> value
```
