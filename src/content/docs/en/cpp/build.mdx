## The Build Process

You've probably heard the terms `build` and `compile`, and even though they are different processes, they are actually used for the same thing, which is to convert source code into an executable binary.

There is (as far as I know) no general agreement or standard between `build` and `compile`, but in this case we will refer to these terms as two different things.
- **compile**: convert source code to assembly code.
- **build**: series of steps that are executed in sequence (among them, build and linking to name a few) that convert source code into executable binary.

You can run the full build process with the following command:

<Terminal
    title="Build a simple cpp file"
    content="g++ main.cpp -o main"
/>

### Pre-processor

<Definition term="pre-processor">
The preprocessor performs preliminary operations on C and C++ files before they are passed to the compiler.

</Definition>

[Minimal example](https://github.com/harleylara/cpp-intro/blob/master/001-intro/main.cpp)
<Terminal
    title="Pre-process only"
    content="g++ -E main.cpp > main.i"
/>

[Simple example](https://github.com/harleylara/cpp-intro/blob/master/001-intro/pre.cpp)
<Terminal
    title="Build simple macro example for logging"
    content="g++ pre.cpp -DDEBUG=1 -o pre && ./pre"
/>

More about pre-processor in [Preprocessor directives](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/preprocessor/).

### Compiler

<Terminal
    title="Compile only"
    content="g++ -S main.i"
/>

### Assembler

<Terminal
    title="Assembly only"
    content="g++ -c main.s"
/>

### Linker

<Terminal
    title="Linking only"
    content="g++ main.o -o main"
/>

Demo minimal library:
<Terminal
    title="Compile and assemble, but do not link. (not yet)"
    content="g++ -c simplelib.cpp -o simplelib.o"
/>

Compile your program and link the library:
<Terminal
    title="Compile the main program and link"
    content="g++ link.cpp simplelib.o -o link && ./link"
/>

This was a `static library` example.

## Build System: `CMake`

A build system is a set of tools and practices used to automate the process of build source code into executable software, along with managing dependencies, configurations, and other tasks related to the software development process. Check this [list of build automation software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software).

[CMake Demo](https://github.com/harleylara/cpp-intro/blob/master/001-intro/CMakeLists.txt)

<Terminal
    title="Build with CMake"
    content="mkdir build\
cd build\
cmake ..\
make"
/>

Run executable
<Terminal
    title="Run demo linking"
    content="./link"
/>


ROS use [colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/) (collective construction): A `CLI` tool to build projects (python or cpp). `colcon` uses [ament_cmake](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Documentation.html) which is a wrapper around `CMAKE`.
