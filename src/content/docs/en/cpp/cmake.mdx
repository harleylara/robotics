The key concept on CMake is: `target`


> A CMake-based buildsystem is organized as a set of high-level logical targets. Each target corresponds to an executable or library, or is a custom target containing custom commands. Dependencies between the targets are expressed in the buildsystem to determine the build order and the rules for regeneration in response to change.

It kickoff stating what cmake is, and mention the core concept of `targets`. I was suprising for search the whole the CMake documentation and not be able to find what CMake Defined as a target (to the best of my knowled at the time of writing Nov. 2025), it mention the type of targets but what is a target itself ?

We can say that: A target is a named node in CMake’s build graph that carries properties (sources, compile options/defs, link libs, usage requirements) and dependency edges.

> Targets names created with `add_executable()`, `add_library()`, or `add_custom_target()` are logical build target names. Logical target names must be globally unique.

## The command `add_*`

In the conceptual model of cmake as a graph (in practice is simular with some extra structures), a target is a **node** in the graph and the command `add_executable()` for example is a way to **add** a note (type executable hence binary target)
