[The "Complete" Beethoven](https://www.completebeethoven.com/index.html)

I have always had great admiration for Beethoven's music. I even visited his house (Beethoven-Haus - Bonn) at least six times while I was living in Bonn from November 2023 to March 2025. Although I am not the most knowledgeable about his entire catalog and work, I have always been a fan of a good story, and this is one of them.

## Christ on the Mount of Olives (Beethoven)

As I said before, I am not the most knowledgeable person when it comes to Beethoven's massive music catalog. I know his most renowned works, the ones you probably know too. But the way I discovered this piece was, to say the least, peculiar.

On September 3 2023, I was about to fly from El Salvador to Germany. while checking in at the airport, the friendly airline attendant assisting me asked, *"Would you like to upgrade your ticket to business class for free?"* For a second, my brain went silent, processing what I had just heard. It was clearly a unique opportunity, and with a serene attitude, I replied, *"Of course!"*, deep down I was still processing what was happening, but I tried to keep my cool so I wouldn't explode with excitement in public and look weird.

During long flights I tend to watch one or two movies, sleep, and explore the plane’s music catalog with the idea of discovering new artists or pieces of music. And that was it: I got on the plane and, while waiting for takeoff, I decided to play some music. I saw the name ["Beethoven: Christ on the Mount of Olives"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_on_the_Mount_of_Olives_(Beethoven))
and thought, oh, interesting, I’ve never heard this work before, I specifically listened to [Beethoven: Christ on the Mount of Olives, by London Symphony Orchestra,  Release date: 3 November 2020](https://lsolive.lso.co.uk/products/lso0862-beethoven), see [Spotify Album](https://open.spotify.com/album/2qpezSi6WzzcBbDLZubdBS) as reference.

I have to say that, even with the greatest of my efforts, it would be impossible to replicate the sensation: it was such a unique way of not just listening to music, but truly experiencing it. Just imagine, the turbulence of takeoff while “Meine Seele ist erschüttert!” resounded, as I looked through the window at the night landscape of San Salvador, the lights like stars against a cloudy sky, with flashes of lightning that occasionally coincided with the music.

After the bloom of emotions and sensations that came from listening to the entire album under such an unlikely set of coincidences, my curiosity couldn’t resist going deeper into the piece and its origins, and so I set out to look for an analysis of the work. That’s when I came across with [“Christ on the Mount of Olives”: Beethoven’s Passion Oratorio By Michael De Sapio](https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2020/03/christ-on-the-mount-of-olives-passion-oratorio-beethoven-250.html). As I read, I was surprised to find a reference to something that, at that moment, was completely unknown to me: the [Heiligenstadt Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiligenstadt_Testament). And, like pulling on a thread that wouldn’t stop unwinding, I read the testament, it felt like a glimpse into Beethoven’s soul. A "new" Beethoven, so different from the one everyone usually talks about. I saw a man -- and I use the word man deliberately, as a direct analogy to a mortal being, not the exalted master who redefined music -- he appeared fragile, exposed, I could see his fears, his shames, it was a view into his deeply human vulnerability.

For now, this section will remain as it is.

I hope to visit Heiligenstadt someday, specifically the house where Beethoven wrote one of his wills. Maybe after that visit, I can return to this passage and reflect on the testament as an exposition of human frailty and the unseen battles that lie behind greatness and fame.

At its heart, good music is the telling of good stories
