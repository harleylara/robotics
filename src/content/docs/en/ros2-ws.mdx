## Names in ROS 2

Names can be:
- absolute path (begins with `/`): `/global/name`
- relative path: `relative/name`
- privately (begins with `~`): `~private/name`
- namespace: namespace prefix to apply to entities associated with the node (node name, topics, etc). `/namespace/name`

## The Workspace

The concept of workspace is ROS VERSION independent.

<Definition
    term="ROS workspace"
    definition="A workspace is a directory containing **ROS packages**."
    source="Creating a workspace | Official documentation"
    link="https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html"
/>

But, what is a ROS package?... more about it later, for now just think about a box with some code in it, trust me.

The workspace contains:
- Packages
    - Executables
    - Libraries
    - Message definitions
- Meta-Packages (ROS 1): a package containing other packages
    - [Metapackages ROS 1](http://wiki.ros.org/Metapackages)

### Underlay

<Definition
    term="Underlay workspace"
    definition="It contains the necessary dependencies of all the packages required by the 'overlay'."
    source="Configuring environment | Official documentation"
    link="https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Configuring-ROS2-Environment.html"
/>

<Drawio
    file="ros.drawio"
    page="3"
    description="Underlay workspace."
/>

Let's explore our underlay workspace: `/opt/ros/humble/`

<Important
    note="Keep in mind that an underlay does not necessarily have to be the main ROS 2 installation."
/>

### Overlay

<Definition
    term="Overlay workspace"
    definition="Extends the underlay. (You will normally work here)."
    source="Configuring environment | Official documentation"
    link="https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Configuring-ROS2-Environment.html"
/>

Note, that for some reason unknown to me, the terms "underlay" and "overlay" are not frequently used. The vast majority of people when they refer to workspace it is usually the overlay workspace.

<Drawio
    file="ros.drawio"
    page="4"
    description="Overlay workspace."
/>

Workspace activation is accumulative.

## Create a Workspace

Create a overlay workspace is simple as creating a folder using the `mkdir` `bash` command. Just keep in mind that this folder MUST contain a `src` folder inside. Inside the `src` folder your packages will live.

<Terminal
    title="create a workspace"
    content="mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src \
    cd ~/ros2_ws"
/>

## Building a Workspace

The build tool in ROS 2 is called `colcon` (collective construction). colcon is an iteration on the ROS build tools `catkin_make`, `catkin_make_isolated`, `catkin_tools` and `ament_tools`. `colcon` compile, test and install packages for you.

Try to run the following commands:

<Terminal
    title="build workspace"
    content="cd ~/ros2_ws \
    colcon build --symlink-install"
/>

Failure? Why? hint: the `ament_cmake` is a ROS package that is currently no available.

The option `--symlink-install` creates a symlink to their original locations instead of copying.

This will create a three folders:
- `build`
- `install`
- `log`

<Important
    note="You should always run the build command from the ROOT of the workspace"
/>

### Build Tools

`colcon` is the tool in charge of compiling the workspace, but internally it uses other build systems depending on the type of package to compile or test.

In ROS2 is usually:
- CMake for C++
- setuptools for python


### Installing Dependencies

Managing dependencies:

<Terminal
    title="install dependencies with rosdep"
    content="rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro humble -y"
/>

## Source a Workspace (Activate it)

Don't forget to source your underlay in EVERY terminal you open.

<Terminal
    title="source underlay"
    content="source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash"
/>

<Terminal
    title="source overlay"
    content="source ~/ros2_ws/local_setup.bash"
/>

External reference on sourcing [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html#source-the-overlay)

What is the diference on `setup.bash` in the underlay an `local_setup.bash` in the overlay?

- `setup.bash` in the underlay under `/opt/ros/<DISTO>/setup.bash` enables all the packages in the underlay.
- `local_setup.bash` in the overlay under (usually) `~/<YOUR WORKSPACE>/install/local_setup.bash` enables the ONLY the current workspace.
- `setup.bash` in the overlay under `~/<YOUR WORKSPACE>/install/setup.bash` enables the current workspace as well as the underlay it was created in.

<Important
    note="You may need to re-source the workspace after adding new packages"
/>

### Sourcing Tips

- `.bashrc`
