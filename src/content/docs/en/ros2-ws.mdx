## Names in ROS 2

Names can be:
- relative path
- absolute path (begins with `\`)
- privately (begins with `~`)
- namespace: namespace prefix to apply to entities associated with the node (node name, topics, etc).

## The Workspace

The concept of workspace is ROS VERSION independent.

ROS workspace: "A workspace is a directory containing ROS packages."

The workspace contains:
- Packages
    - Executables
    - Libraries
    - Message definitions
- Meta-Packages (ROS 1): a package containing other packages
    - [Metapackages ROS 1](http://wiki.ros.org/Metapackages)

### Underlay

A underlay workspace: It contains the necessary dependencies of all the packages required by the "overlay".

### Overlay

Overlay: Extends the underlay. (You will normally work here)

<Important
    note="Keep in mind that an underlay does not necessarily have to be the main ROS 2 installation."
/>

Workspace activation is accumulative.

## Create a Workspace

<Terminal
    title="create a workspace"
    content="mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src \
    cd ~/ros2_ws"
/>

## Building a Workspace

The build tool in ROS 2 is called `colcon` (collective construction). colcon is an iteration on the ROS build tools `catkin_make`, `catkin_make_isolated`, `catkin_tools` and `ament_tools`.

`colcon` compile, test and install packages for you.

<Terminal
    title="build workspace"
    content="cd ~/ros2_ws \
    colcon build --symlink-install"
/>

The option `--symlink-install` creates a symlink to their original locations instead of copying.

This will create a three folders:
- `build`
- `install`
- `log`

<Important
    note="You should always run the build command from the ROOT of the workspace"
/>

### Build Tools

`colcon` is the tool in charge of compiling the workspace, but internally it uses other build systems depending on the type of package to compile or test.

In ROS2 is usually:
- CMake for C++
- setuptools for python


### Installing Dependencies

Managing dependencies:

<Terminal
    title="install dependencies with rosdep"
    content="rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro humble -y"
/>

## Source a Workspace (Activate it)

Don't forget to source your underlay in EVERY terminal you open.

<Terminal
    title="source underlay"
    content="source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash"
/>

<Terminal
    title="source overlay"
    content="source ~/ros2_ws/local_setup.bash"
/>

External reference on sourcing [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html#source-the-overlay)

What is the diference on `setup.bash` in the underlay an `local_setup.bash` in the overlay?

- `setup.bash` in the underlay under `/opt/ros/<DISTO>/setup.bash` enables all the packages in the underlay.
- `local_setup.bash` in the overlay under (usually) `~/<YOUR WORKSPACE>/install/local_setup.bash` enables the ONLY the current workspace.
- `setup.bash` in the overlay under `~/<YOUR WORKSPACE>/install/setup.bash` enables the current workspace as well as the underlay it was created in.

<Important
    note="You may need to re-source the workspace after adding new packages"
/>

### Sourcing Tips

- `.bashrc`
