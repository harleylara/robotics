## Background (TL;DR)

For a long time I've watend to have a personal documentation website equipped with all sorts of tools to make the content more engaging and interactive, but without shooting myself in the foot with complicated markup languages and long editing time. So after years trying out different platforms, frameworks, libraries and markups I realize that I love the simplicity of `markdown`, but for those features it falls short in interactivity and modularity (and that's fine), but I would love to have the option of defining more dynamic content. At that point it comes into play [`MDX`](https://mdxjs.com/), as they say "Markdown for the component era".

Ok, problem solved (really?). Clearly the decision to use MDX is just the tip of the iceberg, there are still other problems to deal with, such as file-based routing, multi-language support, integrations, bundling, asset handling, optimizations and more, I even considered at the time *"Should I write such a framework?"*, after a couple of days thinking about it I came across [`Astro`](https://astro.build/) (version 1.0 rc had just been pre-released - July 26 2022), it was love at first sight, I still remember the level of excitement that grew more and more as I read about its features, since then I have been experimenting with it and it is just perfect.

**In a nutshell**, this site is powered by [Astro](https://astro.build/) and some amazing integrations.

## Define Title

To define a title use the `frontmatter` `title` to properly source it to the meta-data of the page:
```
---
title: "Define you title like this"
---
```

## Hi there!

This Markdown file creates a page at `your-domain.com/page-1/`

It probably isn't styled much, but Markdown does support:
- **bold** and _italics._
- lists
- [links](https://astro.build)
- and more!

Some `backticks` for inline.

```js
backtick.fences('for blocks')
```

A backslash\
before a line breakâ€¦

![](/banner.png)

Using `Figure` component:

```
<Figure
    src="/banner.png"
    description="Figure description here"
/>
```

<Figure
    src="/banner.png"
    description="Figure description here"
/>

This is just a list:
1. slajsld
2. askjlda
3. flksljd

<Canvas
    description="Describe the image here"
/>

## Mathematical Equations

You can define `inline` math equation by using dolar sign `$`. E.g. `$2+2$` when is render looks like this $2+2$.

Markdown latex is also supported (but not recommended):
$$
f(x) = x + a
$$

The recommended way is using the `Math` component:
```
<Math 
    formula="f(x) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}" 
    description="Just a description"
/>
```

<Math 
    formula="f(x) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + \evh" 
    description="Just a description"
/>

All the custom macros apply for inline LaTeX $\m{A}$.

Numbers and Arrays
- Scalar: $a$ (integer or real)
- Vector: $\va$
- Matrix: $\mA$
- Tensor $\tA$

## Code Blocks

```js filename="index.js"
console.log(1)
```

## Embedding Diagrams

To create diagram I like to use [Drawio](https://www.draw.io/). The problem I have always faced is having to export the diagram after making changes and making sure to use the same name and put it in the same folder to overwrite the previus one, and I know, it sounds simple but it gets tedious, for that reason I created the `Drawio` component for embedding the diagram `file` directly into the notes (no more annoying export).

When many diagrams are produced the way I always organize them in a Drawio file `.drawio` containing "pages" in it, and each page is a different diagram.

IMPORTANT: All diagrams should be placed in the `resources` folder.

```
<Drawio 
    file="test.drawio"
    page="1"
    description="Insert the description of your diagram"
/>
```

<Drawio 
    file="test.drawio"
    page="1"
/>

<Drawio 
    file="test.drawio"
    page="2"
/>
