The important take a way here:
> Learn to perform a task from experience

Who do we measure learning?
- performance measure
- learning = optimization

## Probability Theory

As Prof. Chris Bishop said: "I still think that students should learn the basic ideas of Bayesian inference [...]. You have to learn about probability, I don't think you can be a machine learning and not understand probability [...]". [Prof. Chris Bishop's NEW Deep Learning Textbook](https://youtu.be/kuvFoXzTK3E?t=751)

Check my notes in [probability](/en/probability) for more details.

Basic rules:
- sum rule
- product rule

<Equation
    formula="P(X) = \sum_{Y} P(X, Y)"
    description="Sum rule of probability."

<Equation
    formula="P(X,Y) = P(Y|X)P(X)"
    description="Product rule of probability."
/>

<Equation
    formula="P(Y,X) = \frac{P(X, Y) P(Y)}{P(X)}"
    description="Bayesâ€™ theorem"
