The important take a way here:
> Learn to perform a task from experience

Who do we measure learning?
- performance measure
- learning = optimization

## Probability Theory

As Prof. Chris Bishop said: "I still think that students should learn the basic ideas of Bayesian inference [...]. You have to learn about probability, I don't think you can be a machine learning and not understand probability [...]". [Prof. Chris Bishop's NEW Deep Learning Textbook](https://youtu.be/kuvFoXzTK3E?t=751)

Basic rules:
- sum rule
- product rule

<Equation>
    $$
    P(X) = \sum_{Y} P(X, Y)
    $$
    Sum rule of probability.
</Equation>

<Equation>
    $$
    P(X,Y) = P(Y|X)P(X)
    $$
    Product rule of probability.
</Equation>

<Equation>
    $$
    P(Y,X) = \frac{P(X, Y) P(Y)}{P(X)}
    $$
    Bayes’ theorem
</Equation>
