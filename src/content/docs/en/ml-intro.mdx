Who do we measure learning?
- performance measure
- learning = optimization

## Probability Theory

Check my notes in [probability](/en/probability) for more details.

Basic rules:
- sum rule
- product rule

<Equation
    formula="P(X) = \sum_{Y} P(X, Y)"
    description="Sum rule of probability."
/>

<Equation
    formula="P(X,Y) = P(Y|X)P(X)"
    description="Product rule of probability."
/>

<Equation
    formula="P(Y,X) = \frac{P(X, Y) P(Y)}{P(X)}"
    description="Bayesâ€™ theorem"
/>
