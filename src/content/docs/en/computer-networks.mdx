## Introduction

variety of transmission media:
- copper
- fiber optic
- radio waves

the most common model is the **client-server model**, other models:
- peer-to-peer (example: BitTorrent)

### Network Technology, from Local to Global

- Personal area networks (PAN): like Bluetooth
- Local are networks (LAN)
    - [IEEE 802.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11) (commonly called WiFi)
    - [IEEE 802.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.3) (commonly called Ethernet)
    - Virtual LAN (VLAN)
- Metropolitan area networks (MAN)
- Wide area networks (WAN)

### Network Protocols

Design goals:
- reliability
    - error detection
    - error correction
    - routing
- resource allocation
    - statistical multiplexing
    - flow control
    - congestion
    - Quality of service (QoS)
- evolvability
    - addressing/naming
- security


connection-oriented service:
