## Short About DDS

Communication paradigms:
- Topics (asynchronous): Publication/Subscription
- Services (synchronous): Request/Response
- Actions (asynchronous): Request/Response with feedback (something conceptually similar to long polling and WebSockets)

## ROS Interfaces

- **Topics**: uses messages defined with a `.msg` file to communicate between "publishers" and "subscribers".
- **Services**: uses services defined with a `.srv` filo to communicate between "service clients" and "service servers".
- **Actions**: uses actitios with a `.action` file to communicate between "action clients" and "action servers"

## Topics

Topics are:
- publishers/subscribers
- Anonymous
- Strongly-typed

/>

For details about topics names: check [Names in ROS 2](/en/ros2-ws#names-in-ros-2).

### Publishers/Subscribers

Topics use a asynchronous communication paradigms refer as publication/subscription:
- publishers don’t know if anyone’s listening
- subscribers are event-triggered (by incoming messages)
- messages may be dropped

### Anonymous

Topics are anonymous: "This means that when a subscriber gets a piece of data, it doesn’t generally know or care which publisher originally sent it (though it can find out if it wants). " from [Official ROS docs](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/Basic/About-Topics.html#anonymous).

### Strongly-typed

The communication using topic relies in the concept of messages.

## Messages

Messages are a way for a ROS 2 node to send data on the network to other ROS nodes, with no response expected.

### Message Definition Structure

<Drawio
    file="ros.drawio"
    page="7"
    description="Simple message definition."
/>

Structure:
- Fiel type
- Field name
- Field with constant value
- Feilf with default value

### Field Types

- [Built-in-type](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/Basic/About-Interfaces.html#field-types)
- Using other message as the type to define a field (nesting messages)

### Field with Constant Value

<Important
    note="Field names with constant values have to be UPPERCASE"
/>
