## Short About DDS

Communication paradigms:
- Topics (asynchronous): Publication/Subscription
- Services (synchronous): Request/Response
- Actions (asynchronous): Request/Response with feedback (something conceptually similar to long polling and WebSockets)

## ROS Interfaces

- **Topics**: uses messages defined with a `.msg` file to communicate between "publishers" and "subscribers".
- **Services**: uses services defined with a `.srv` filo to communicate between "service clients" and "service servers".
- **Actions**: uses actitios with a `.action` file to communicate between "action clients" and "action servers"

## Topics

Topics are:
- publishers/subscribers
- Anonymous
- Strongly-typed

## Anonymous

## Strongly-typed

The communication using topic relies in the concept of messages.

### Messages

Messages are a way for a ROS 2 node to send data on the network to other ROS nodes, with no response expected.
