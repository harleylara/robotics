## Short About DDS

Communication paradigms:
- Topics (asynchronous): Publication/Subscription
- Services (synchronous): Request/Response
- Actions (asynchronous): Request/Response with feedback (something conceptually similar to long polling and WebSockets)

## ROS Interfaces

- **Topics**: uses messages defined with a `.msg` file to communicate between "publishers" and "subscribers".
- **Services**: uses services defined with a `.srv` filo to communicate between "service clients" and "service servers".
- **Actions**: uses actitios with a `.action` file to communicate between "action clients" and "action servers"


## Services

Services are described and defined in .srv files in the srv/ directory of a ROS package.
