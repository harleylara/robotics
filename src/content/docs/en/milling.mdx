## Drilling Operation

| Tool Ø (mm) | RPM (safe start) | Use case                                    |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| < 1 mm      | 20,000–40,000    | Microdrilling only with high-speed spindles |
| 1–2 mm      | 8,000–16,000     | Common range for small drills               |
| > 3 mm      | 3,000–10,000     | More stable for general drilling            |

## Roughing

| Material       | Roughing Step-over | Finishing Step-over |
|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Aluminum       | 50–70%             | 5–10%               |
| Steel          | 40–60%             | 5–10%               |
| Titanium       | 30–50%             | 3–8%                |
| Hardened Steel | 20–40%             | 2–6%                |
| Plastics       | 60–80%             | 10–15%              |

Axial Depth of Cut (ADOC) by Material (with Carbide End Mill)

| Material        | Roughing ADOC  | Finishing ADOC  |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Aluminum        | 1×D – 2×D      | 0.1×D – 0.25×D  |
| Mild Steel      | 0.5×D – 1×D    | 0.05×D – 0.2×D  |
| Stainless Steel | 0.25×D – 0.5×D | 0.05×D – 0.15×D |
| Titanium        | 0.25×D – 0.4×D | 0.05×D – 0.1×D  |
| Plastics        | 1×D – 2×D      | 0.2×D – 0.3×D   |
