  abstractNote = {Monocular depth estimation is often described as an illposed and inherently ambiguous problem. Estimating depth from 2D images is a crucial step in scene reconstruction, 3D object recognition, segmentation, and detection. The problem can be framed as: given a single RGB image as input, predict a dense depth map for each pixel. This problem is worsened by the fact that most scenes have large texture and structural variations, object occlusions, and rich geometric detailing. All these factors contribute to difﬁculty in accurate depth estimation. In this paper, we review ﬁve papers that attempt to solve the depth estimation problem with various techniques including supervised, weakly-supervised, and unsupervised learning techniques. We then compare these papers and understand the improvements made over one another. Finally, we explore potential improvements that can aid to better solve this problem.},

  abstractNote = {Depth estimation from monocular images has become a prominent focus in photogrammetry and computer vision research. Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE), which involves determining depth from a single RGB image, offers numerous advantages, including applications in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), scene comprehension, 3D modeling, robotics, and autonomous driving. Depth information retrieval becomes especially crucial in situations where other sources like stereo images, optical flow, or point clouds are not available. In contrast to traditional stereo or multi-view methods, MDE techniques require fewer computational resources and smaller datasets. This research work presents a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of some state-of-the-art MDE methods, considering their ability to infer depth information in terrestrial images. The evaluation includes quantitative assessments using ground truth data, including 3D analyses and inference time.},
