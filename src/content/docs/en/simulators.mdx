title: Robotics Simulators
description: A (almost) complete list of robotics simulators
---

@gutierrezDistributedRealtimeFramework2018

This list is intended to be as complete as possible but obviously it is virtually impossible to list **ALL** the robot simulators out there, that's the reason why the “almost” in the description of this note. In case you know of a simulator that is not included in this list, here are the possible reasons for its absence:
- I haven't updated the list yet: there are always new simulators.
- I have not yet come across it: the simulator can be very niche.
- The "simulator" could be a random project of someone on the internet. In that case it is up to my personal judgment to include it or not, depending on the value of the simulator, clearly this is subject to my personal bias.

## Disambiguations

- [Physics engine - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_engine) *"is computer software that provides an approximate simulation of certain physical systems, typically classical dynamics, including rigid body dynamics (including collision detection), soft body dynamics, and fluid dynamics."*
- [Render engine] a list with some examples in [List of 3D rendering software - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_3D_rendering_software)
- [Game engine - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine) as reference see [List of game engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_game_engines): *"is a software framework primarily designed for the development of video games which generally includes relevant libraries and support programs such as a level editor."*
- [Robotics simulator - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics_simulator): *"is a simulator used to create an application for a physical robot without depending on the physical machine, thus saving cost and time."*

What makes a robotics simulator a robotics simulator:
- robot model support: Support for standard robotic models (URDF, SDF)
- sensors: LIDAR, cameras, IMU, force-torque
- Multi-body Dynamics: Simulates rigid and soft body interactions relevant to robots.
- Sensor Noise & Distortions: Allows realistic sensor imperfections for real-world applicability.
- physics Fidelity: More focus on realistic kinematics and dynamics rather than high-speed rendering.
- Direct API: for multiples programming languages
- communication APIs
