title: Robotics Simulators
description: A (almost) complete list of robotics simulators
---

This list is intended to be as complete as possible but obviously it is virtually impossible to list **ALL** the robot simulators out there, that's the reason why the “almost” in the description of this note. In case you know of a simulator that is not included in this list, here are the possible reasons for its absence:
- I haven't updated the list yet: there are always new simulators.
- I have not yet come across it: the simulator can be very niche.
- The "simulator" could be a random project of someone on the internet. In that case it is up to my personal judgment to include it or not, depending on the value of the simulator, clearly this is subject to my personal bias.
