Standard library:
- array
- vector
- string
- streams

Sequence containers:
- array
- vector
- deque
- list
- forward list

Associative containers:
- set, multiset,
- map, multimap

Unordered containers (hash table):
- Unordered set/multiset
- Unordered map/multiset

## Array

/>

- Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size determined at compile time and cannot be resized dynamically.
- Contiguous Memory Allocation: Elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations, which allows for efficient traversal and access.
- Random Access: Elements in an array can be accessed directly using an index, providing $O(1)$ time complexity for access.
- Homogeneous Elements: Arrays can only contain elements of the same data type. They cannot store elements of different data types within the same array.
- Static Allocation: Memory for arrays is allocated statically either on the stack or in the global/static memory segment.

## Vector

<Drawio

    description="vector container memory layout."
/>

```plain
#include <vector>
```

Dynamical array. continuous memory allocation.
- fast insert/remove at the end: O(1)
- slow insert/remove at the beginning or in the middle: O(n)
- slow search: O(n)

## Deque

**Deque** or double-ended queue.

The complexity (efficiency) of common operations on deques is as follows:
- Random access - constant $O(1)$.
- Insertion or removal of elements at the end or beginning - constant $O(1)$.
- Insertion or removal of elements - linear $O(n)$.
- Slow search: $O(n)$
