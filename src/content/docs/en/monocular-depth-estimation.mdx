### Evaluating monocular depth estimation methods

@padkanEVALUATINGMONOCULARDEPTH2023

Methods to evaluate:
- DPT
    - The method adopts the Vision Transformer (ViT)
- ZoeDepth
    - combines both monocular depth estimation (MDE) and relative depth estimation (RDE)
- MiDaS
    - that are invariant to scale and shift to address uncertainties in true depth labels
    - MiDaS V1 and V2 utilize ResNet-based design. MiDaS v3.1, five encoder types.
- DenseDepth (@alhashimHighQualityMonocular2019)
    - it utilizes feature representations from well-performing pre-trained (DenseNet-169 on ImageNet) networks to initialize the encoder.

They dont show the sources that lead to pick these method: "The scientific literature and other reputable sources like Paper with Codes have highlighted these algorithms as top performers"

Method(s) for evaluation:
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Relative Error (MRE)
- Peek signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)
- Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)
- Edge sharpness analysis:
    - Motion transfer function (MTF)
    - The edge spread function (ESF)
    - Line Spread Function (LSF)
- cloud-to-cloud distances ??

Datasets for assessment:
- [ENRICH](https://github.com/davidemarelli/ENRICH)
- [ArchDepth2](https://3dom.fbk.eu/projects/on-going/archdepth)
