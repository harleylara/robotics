## Rules

1. For EVERY result, keep track of how it was produced.
    - pre-processing
    - post processing
    - very detail that may influence the execution of the step is recorded
    - If is software include name and version of the software
2. Avoid manual data manipulation steps
    - operations like the use of copy and paste between documents should also be avoided
3. Archive the exact version of all external programs used
4. Version control all custom scripts
5. Record all intermediate results, when possible in standardized formats
6. For analysis that include randomness, note underlying random seeds
7. Always store raw data behind plots
8. Generate hierarchical analysis Output, allowing layers of increasing detail to be inspected
9. Connect textual statements to underlying results
