export const components = {
    blockquote: Blockquote,
    a: A,
    pre: Pre,
    code: CodeBlock,
    pre: InlineCode,
    em: Em,

Let's make things clear, backpropagation is in reality **automatic differentiation in reverse mode** and was initially proposed by Seppo Linnainmaa in 1970 (for more historical details check my notes in [AI history](ai-history))
