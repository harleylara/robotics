## Open-Hardware Vs Open-Standards

You've probably heard the term **open-source software** (OSS), but have you heard of **open-hardware**?, also referred to as **open-source hardware** (OSH), what about **open-standard**?

[The Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd) see a list of [OSI Approved Licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses). Extra see the annotated version of the [The Open SOurce Definition](https://opensource.org/definition-annotated)
