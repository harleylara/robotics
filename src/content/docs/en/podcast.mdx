## [ep15 - Davide Scaramuzza: Vision-based Autonomous Navigation, Agile Drone Racing, Event Cameras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtVzgrbmGiQ)

Notes:
- 2019: move to drones, [sFly Quadrotors Navigate Outdoors All By Themselves](https://spectrum.ieee.org/sfly-quadrotors-navigate-outdoors-all-by-themselves)
- [90% of the energy of a drone is used to fly](https://youtu.be/XtVzgrbmGiQ?t=581)

Why drone racing task for research:
- Is all about optimal flight speed to maximize battery use vs. distance. [Range, Endurance, and Optimal Speed Estimates for Multicopters](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04741.pdf)
