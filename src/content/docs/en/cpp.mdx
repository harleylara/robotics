## Prerequisites for Diving

Knowledge required:
- Proficiency with basic terminal commands (bash).
- Understand GNU/Linux file system.
- I expect that you already know the general concepts of programming, including interpreted vs. compiled.
- Basics of VCS (Version control system) with git.

Software requirements:
- Text editor: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extension:
    - [C/C++ by Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
- Compiler: `gcc`, a reference article for installation, [Using GCC with MinGW](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw#_prerequisites).

## The Build Process

You've probably heard the terms `build` and `compile`, and even though they are different processes, they are actually used for the same thing, which is to convert source code into an executable binary.

There is (as far as I know) no general agreement or standard between `build` and `compile`, but in this case we will refer to these terms as two different things.
- **compile**: convert source code to assembly code.
- **build**: series of steps that are executed in sequence (among them, build and linking to name a few) that convert source code into executable binary.

Coding aspect (basics):
- variables
- conditions
- arrays
- loops
- structs
- functions
- classes
- pointers
- inheritance
- function templates
- class templates
