## First

Rules:
1. Do not injure myself during traing nor during race
2. Enjoy the process

Goals (this are for the age range from 18-35 male):
- Be average: 4 hours mark. 5.714 min/km
- Top 25%: 3h 31min. 5 min/km
- Top 10%: 3h 2min. 4.285 min/km
- Top 5%: 2h 50min. 4.043 min/km (this is a [qualifier time for Bostom Marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon_Qualifying_Standards))
- National record Nicaragua: [2:20:39 by William Aguirre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nicaraguan_records_in_athletics#Men) 3.33 min/km

## Phase 1: Understanding


Resources to check:
- @blagroveSciencePracticeMiddle2021

## Phase 2: Data Collection and Test

medical grade check:
- Full-body checkout
- Running lactate and VO2max
- Current body composition

| Age Group | Top 25% | Median  | Bottom 25% |
|-----------|---------|---------|------------|
| Under 35  | 3:31:43 | 4:04:20 | 4:48:05    |

## Phase 3: Planning

- Get a god recovery program
- Set a food plan
- Focus on running techinique
- traing on the upperbound of Zone 2


## Phase 4: Execution and Tracking

## Metrics

[Michail J. Joyner](https://youtu.be/J7mna-hM5v8?t=16), body as a complex machine:
- VO2max: aerobic capacity. Car engine size
- Running economy: efficiency. Kilometers per galon
- Lactate threshold: How long can the engine run before start overheating

adenosine triphosphate (ATPs) as a core **energy (battery)**. [See this explanation](https://youtu.be/J7mna-hM5v8?t=102)

Start metrics:
- I need to get my Max Heart Rate (Max. HR)

Things to check:
- Gastrointestinal (GI) system

Measures:
- Calories per hour: example 500
- Train in zone 2 60–70% Heart rate

(Testing in a lab with lactate/VO₂ is more accurate, but most people don’t need that.)


Goal, econimic and optimal energy use

## Training Order

1. VO2max is the main factor for less than 5km runs
2. Lactate: max speed maintain without triggering dramatic blood lactate.

## Big Players

- cardiac
- pulmonary
- muscular
