Section 1.1.3 @hamannSwarmRoboticsFormal2018

Properties of a swarm robotic system:
- decentralized control
- lack of synchronicity
- simple (quasi) identical members, or quasi-homogeneous members which are mass produced.

(Harley note) I like this: *"A robust system is a reliable system and a reliable system can be created based on unreliable parts via redundancy."* from section 1.1.4 @hamannSwarmRoboticsFormal2018 with original source @baranReliableDigitalCommunications1960

How density affect performance: see @lermanMathematicalModelForaging2002

### Swarm Performance

<Equation
    formula="\Pi(N) = \frac{N}{e^{N}}"
    description="Swarm performance"
/>

Where:
- $N$: is the number of robots and is defined by $N=pA$, $p$ density (robots per area) and $A$ area.

See Equation (1.1) @hamannSwarmRoboticsFormal2018

### Universal Scalability Law

@guntherSimpleCapacityModel1993

### Communication

types:
- Explicit
- Implicit (cue-based communication)
    - Stigmergy

### Two levels

- micro: individual agent local view, limited knowledge
- macro: swarm level, global view, all knowledge, full overview

Challenges:
- task defined on macro-level
- implementation/programming on micro-level

### self-Organization

Self-organization is based on four components: positive feedback, negative feedback, multiple interactions, and balance of exploitation and exploration

## Short Journey Through Nearly Everything



## Questionar

What is aggregation? is the act of a swarm to position themselves close to each other on one spot.
- specified spot: each robot has to find that position and stop there
- unspecified spot: robot swarm self-organizes to find a consensus position

aggregation global task: minimization of distances between robots

aggregation local task: position yourself close to as many robots as possible

Common algo for aggregation: BEECLUST, potentail fields is a simple method

What is dispersion? is the oppositve to aggregation. robots position themselves as far as possible but while staying in contact.

Types of dispersion:
- uniform
- random
- clustered

Voronoi gaussian distributed resources and uniform resource distribution

What is clustering: robots position objects close to each other by clustering them in one spot. Minimization of distance between objects.

What is sorting? multiple types of object that need to be clustered

Cooperative construction: a model that operates like a cellular automaton. a local perception of the current contruction side defines the next construction step

Cooperative transport: aggregation + synchronization and collective motion

Flocking: the task is stay together, move in the same direction and avoid collisions

Rules of flocking:
- alignment: adapt direction to that of neighbors
- cohesion: stay close to neighbors
- separation: if too close increase distance to avoid collisions.
- (extra) ignore flockmates in the back

Foraging: task is collect items. with the following subtask:
- exploration: when to explore, risk management
- navigation: GPS, light beacon, pheromones, landmarks
- recruitment: attract other robots to rich food sources
- (collective) transport: pushing only, grasping, caging

-- Division of labor and task partitioning --

What is division of labor: work is organized, not everyone is doing the same task and consequently the work need to be usefully distributed among the workers.
- task partitioning: is the problem of defining smaller pieces of work

What is task allocation? is the problem of assigning tasks to the robots, hopefully in an efficient way.
- if the task allocation is dynamic, then the strategy for task switching is required:
    - monitor current supply and demand
    - determine if task switch would be efficient
    - if so, do it


Taxonomy in multi-robot task allocation

- single-task robots (ST): each robot is capable of executing at most one task at a time
- multi-task robots (MT): some robots can execute multiple tasks simultaneously

- single-robot tasks (SR): each task requires exactly one robot to achieve it
- multi-robot task (MR): some tasks can require multiple robots

- instantaneous assignment (IA): instantaneous allocation of task to robots with o planning for future allocations
- time-extended assignment (TA): information is available such as the set of all tasks that will need to be assigned, or model of how task are expected to arrive over time.
