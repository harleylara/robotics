Factors that influence prop thrust and efficiency:
- more diameter, more thrust due to pushing more air volume. this make it more efficiency due to **disc loading**.
- more blades, more thrust BUT less efficiency due to disturbing air flow from other blades.
- more angel of attack (pitch) more thrust and more efficiency (up to a certain extent) 
- longer blade chord , more thrust
