## Momentum Theory of Rotors

### Frames of Reference

**Inertial frame** $\fI$:
- Origin located on the ground (e.g. base station)
- Conventions:
    - For PX4 and Ardupilot, X North, Y East, Z Down (NED) or X Forward, Y Right, Z Down (FRD)
    - For Robot Operating System (ROS), X East, Y North, Z Up (ENU) or X Forward, Y Left, Z Up (FLU), and usually named [map](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html#id16) or [odom](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html#id15).

**Body frame** $\fB$:
- Origin located at the center of gravity (COG) of the quadrotor
- Convetions:
    - For PX4 and Ardupilot, X Forward, Y Right, Z Down (FRD)
    - For Robot Operating System (ROS), X Forward, Y Left, Z Up (FLU), and usually named [base_link](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html#id14).

The rotor reference frame $\fC$.

Types of powers:
- Electrical power (from battery)
- Mechanical power (from motor)
- Lifting power (prop)

Factors that influence prop thrust and efficiency:
- more diameter, more thrust due to pushing more air volume. this make it more efficiency due to **disc loading**.
- more blades, more thrust BUT less efficiency due to disturbing air flow from other blades.
- more angel of attack (pitch) more thrust and more efficiency (up to a certain extent) 
- longer blade chord , more thrust

## Disk Loading
