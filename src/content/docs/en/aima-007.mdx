## Knowledge-based Agents

Important terms:
- A **sentence** is an assertion about the world.
- The atomic representation of the sentence is called **axiom**.

```text
function KB_AGENT(percept) {

    var KB; // Knowledge base
    var t;

    TELL(KB, Make_Percept_Sentence(percept, t))

    var action = ASK(KB, Make_Action_Query(t))

    TELL(KB, Make_Action_Sentence(action, t))

    t = t + 1;

    return action;
}
```
